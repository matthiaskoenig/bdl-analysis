                        statistical analysis and visualization of
                        functional profiles for genes and gene clusters
                        The package implements methods to analyze and
                        visualize functional profiles of gene and gene
                        clusters.

compareClusterResult-class
                        Class "compareClusterResult" This class
                        represents the comparison result of gene
                        clusters by GO categories at specific level or
                        GO enrichment analysis.

enrichGO                GO Enrichment Analysis of a gene set. Given a
                        vector of genes, this function will return the
                        enrichment GO categories after FDR control.
enrichKEGG              KEGG Enrichment Analysis of a gene set. Given a
                        vector of genes, this function will return the
                        enrichment KEGG categories with FDR control.
