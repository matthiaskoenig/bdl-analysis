  Abstract                 = {Gene expression profiling using RNA-seq is a powerful technique for screening RNA species' landscapes and their dynamics in an unbiased way. While several advanced methods exist for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, proper tools to anal.yze RNA-seq time-course have not been proposed.In this study, we use RNA-seq to measure gene expression during the early human T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation and T-: cell activation (Th0). To quantify Th17-: specific gene expression dynamics, we present a novel statistical methodology, DyNB, for analyzing time-course RNA-seq data. We use non-parametric Gaussian processes to model temporal correlation in gene expression and combine that with negative binomial likelihood for the count data. To account for experiment-: specific biases in gene expression dynamics, such as differences in cell differentiation efficiencies, we propose a method to rescale the dynamics between replicated measurements. We develop an MCMC sampling method to make inference of differential expression dynamics between conditions. DyNB identifies several known and novel genes involved in Th17 differentiation. Analysis of differentiation efficiencies revealed consistent patterns in gene expression dynamics between different cultures. We use qRT-PCR to validate differential expression and differentiation efficiencies for selected genes. Comparison of the results with those obtained via traditional timepoint-: wise analysis shows that time-course analysis together with time rescaling between cultures identifies differentially expressed genes which would not otherwise be detected.An implementation of the proposed computational methods will be available at http://research.ics.aalto.fi/csb/software/},

  Abstract                 = {The lack of bile flow from the liver into the intestine can have devastating complications including hepatic failure, sepsis and even death. This pathologic condition known as cholestasis can result from etiologies as diverse as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), hepatitis and pancreatic cancer. The intestinal injury associated with cholestasis has been shown to result in decreased intestinal resistance, increased bacterial translocation and increased endotoxemia. Anecdotal clinical evidence suggests a genetic predisposition to exaggerated injury. Recent animal research on two different strains of inbred mice demonstrating different rates of bacterial translocation with different mortality rates supports this premise. In this study, a microarray analysis of intestinal tissue following common bile duct ligation (CBDL) performed under general anesthesia on these same two strains of inbred mice was done with the goal of identifying the potential molecular mechanistic pathways responsible. Over 500 genes were increased more than 2.0 fold following CBDL. The most promising candidate genes included MUPs, Serpina1a and LCN-2. RT-PCR validated the microarray results for these candidate genes. In an in vitro experiment using differentiated intestinal epithelial cells, inhibition of MUP-1 by siRNA resulted in increased intestinal epithelial cell permeability. Diverse novel mechanisms involving the growth hormone pathway, the acute phase response and the innate immune response are thus potential avenues for limiting cholestatic intestinal injury. Changes in gene expression were at times found to be not only due to the CBDL but also due to the murine strain. Should further studies in cholestatic patients demonstrate inter-individual variability similar to what we have shown in mice, then a "personalized medicine" approach to cholestatic patients may become possible.},

  Abstract                 = {Inflammation contributes to liver injury during cholestasis. The mechanism by which cholestasis initiates an inflammatory response in the liver, however, is not known. Two hypotheses were investigated in the present studies. First, activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), either by bacterial lipopolysaccharide or by damage-associated molecular pattern molecules released from dead hepatocytes, triggers an inflammatory response. Second, bile acids act as inflammagens, and directly activate signaling pathways in hepatocytes that stimulate production of proinflammatory mediators. Liver inflammation was not affected in lipopolysaccharide-resistant C3H/HeJ mice after bile duct ligation, indicating that Toll-like receptor 4 is not required for initiation of inflammation. Treatment of hepatocytes with bile acids did not directly cause cell toxicity but increased the expression of numerous proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and other proteins that influence immune cell levels and function. Up-regulation of several of these genes in hepatocytes and in the liver after bile duct ligation required early growth response factor-1, but not farnesoid X receptor. In addition, early growth response factor-1 was up-regulated in the livers of patients with cholestasis and correlated with levels of inflammatory mediators. These data demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 4 is not required for the initiation of acute inflammation during cholestasis. In contrast, bile acids directly activate a signaling network in hepatocytes that promotes hepatic inflammation during cholestasis.},

  Abstract                 = {Obstructive cholestasis causes hepatic cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of liver disease are multiple and linked. We propose grouping these mechanisms according to the three phenotypes mainly expressed in the interstitial space in order to integrate them.Experimental extrahepatic cholestasis is the model most frequently used to study obstructive cholestasis. The early liver interstitial alterations described in these experimental models would produce an ischemia/reperfusion phenotype with oxidative and nitrosative stress. Then, the hyperexpression of a leukocytic phenotype, in which Kupffer cells and neutrophils participate, would induce enzymatic stress. And finally, an angiogenic phenotype, responsible for peribiliary plexus development with sinusoidal arterialization, occurs. In addition, an intense cholangiocyte proliferation, which acquires neuroendocrine abilities, stands out. This histopathological finding is also associated with fibrosis.It is proposed that the sequence of these inflammatory phenotypes, perhaps with a trophic meaning, ultimately produces a benign tumoral biliary process - although it poses severe hepatocytic insufficiency. Moreover, the persistence of this benign tumor disease would induce a higher degree of dedifferentiation and autonomy and, therefore, its malign degeneration.},

Algorithms that are specifically designed for time series experiments are required so that we can take advantage of their unique features (such as the ability to infer causality from the temporal response pattern) and address the unique problems they raise (e.g. handling the different non-uniform sampling rates).We present a comprehensive review of the current research in time series expression data analysis. We divide the computational challenges into four analysis levels: experimental design, data analysis, pattern recognition and networks. For each of these levels, we discuss computational and biological problems at that level and point out some of the methods that have been proposed to deal with these issues. Many open problems in all these levels are discussed. This review is intended to serve as both, a point of reference for experimental biologists looking for practical solutions for analyzing their data, and a starting point for computer scientists interested in working on the computational problems related to time series expression analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The morphological interpretation of histologic sections forms the basis of diagnosis and prognostication for cancer. In the diagnosis of carcinomas, pathologists perform a semiquantitative analysis of a small set of morphological features to determine the cancer's histologic grade. Physicians use histologic grade to inform their assessment of a carcinoma's aggressiveness and a patient's prognosis. Nevertheless, the determination of grade in breast cancer examines only a small set of morphological features of breast cancer epithelial cells, which has been largely unchanged since the 1920s. A comprehensive analysis of automatically quantitated morphological features could identify characteristics of prognostic relevance and provide an accurate and reproducible means for assessing prognosis from microscopic image data. We developed the C-Path (Computational Pathologist) system to measure a rich quantitative feature set from the breast cancer epithelium and stroma (6642 features), including both standard morphometric descriptors of image objects and higher-level contextual, relational, and global image features. These measurements were used to construct a prognostic model. We applied the C-Path system to microscopic images from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients [from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) cohort, n = 248, and the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) cohort, n = 328]. The prognostic model score generated by our system was strongly associated with overall survival in both the NKI and the VGH cohorts (both log-rank P ≤ 0.001). This association was independent of clinical, pathological, and molecular factors. Three stromal features were significantly associated with survival, and this association was stronger than the association of survival with epithelial characteristics in the model. These findings implicate stromal morphologic structure as a previously unrecognized prognostic determinant for breast cancer.},

This secretagogue improves, e.g. in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy or early stage primary biliary cirrhosis, impaired hepatocellular and cholangiocellular bile formation mainly by complex post-transcriptional mechanisms. The limited efficacy of UDCA in various cholestatic conditions urges for development of novel therapeutic approaches. These include nuclear and membrane receptor agonists and BA derivatives. The nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and pregnane X receptor (PXR) are transcriptional modifiers of bile formation and at present are under investigation as promising targets for therapeutic interventions in cholestatic disorders. The membrane receptors fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and apical sodium BA transporter (ASBT) deserve attention as additional therapeutic targets, as does the potential therapeutic agent norUDCA, a 23-C homologue of UDCA.

  Abstract                 = {Bile acids are physiological detergents that generate bile flow and facilitate intestinal absorption and transport of lipids, nutrients, and vitamins. Bile acids also are signaling molecules and inflammatory agents that rapidly activate nuclear receptors and cell signaling pathways that regulate lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism. The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids exerts important physiological functions not only in feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis but also in control of whole-body lipid homeostasis. In the liver, bile acids activate a nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), that induces an atypical nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner, which subsequently inhibits nuclear receptors, liver-related homolog-1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha and results in inhibiting transcription of the critical regulatory gene in bile acid synthesis, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). In the intestine, FXR induces an intestinal hormone, fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15; or FGF19 in human), which activates hepatic FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) signaling to inhibit bile acid synthesis. However, the mechanism by which FXR/FGF19/FGFR4 signaling inhibits CYP7A1 remains unknown. Bile acids are able to induce FGF19 in human hepatocytes, and the FGF19 autocrine pathway may exist in the human livers. Bile acids and bile acid receptors are therapeutic targets for development of drugs for treatment of cholestatic liver diseases, fatty liver diseases, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.},

  Abstract                 = {Alterations in apical junctional complexes (AJCs) have been reported in genetic or acquired biliary diseases. The vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR), predominantly expressed in biliary epithelial cells in the liver, has been shown to regulate AJCs. The aim of our study was thus to investigate the role of VDR in the maintenance of bile duct integrity in mice challenged with biliary-type liver injury. Vdr(-/-) mice subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) displayed increased liver damage compared to wildtype BDL mice. Adaptation to cholestasis, ascertained by expression of genes involved in bile acid metabolism and tissue repair, was limited in Vdr(-/-) BDL mice. Furthermore, evaluation of Vdr(-/-) BDL mouse liver tissue sections indicated altered E-cadherin staining associated with increased bile duct rupture. Total liver protein analysis revealed that a truncated form of E-cadherin was present in higher amounts in Vdr(-/-) mice subjected to BDL compared to wildtype BDL mice. Truncated E-cadherin was also associated with loss of cell adhesion in biliary epithelial cells silenced for VDR. In these cells, E-cadherin cleavage occurred together with calpain 1 activation and was prevented by the silencing of calpain 1. Furthermore, VDR deficiency led to the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, while EGFR activation by EGF induced both calpain 1 activation and E-cadherin cleavage in these cells. Finally, truncation of E-cadherin was blunted when EGFR signaling was inhibited in VDR-silenced cells.Biliary-type liver injury is exacerbated in Vdr(-/-) mice by limited adaptive response and increased bile duct rupture. These results indicate that loss of VDR restricts the adaptation to cholestasis and diminishes bile duct integrity in the setting of biliary-type liver injury.},

  Abstract                 = {Liver fibrosis is linked to VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Overexpression of exogenous vasohibin-1, a feedback inhibitor of angiogenesis, has been reported to reduce liver fibrosis after bile duct ligation (BDL). To uncover the function of endogenous vasohibin-1, we performed BDL using vasohibin-1-deficient mice and analyzed liver fibrosis, injury, and angiogenesis. Liver fibrosis was induced by 14-days of BDL in both wild-type and vasohibin-1-deficient mice. The liver sections were stained with anti-CD31 to visualize endothelial cells and with Sirius red to observe fibrotic regions. Total RNAs were purified from the livers and expression of collagen I α1 mRNA was measured by quantitative PCR. Plasma ALT activity was determined to assess liver injury. Surprisingly, the same extents of increases were seen in anti-CD31 and Sirius red stainings, collagen I α1 mRNA expressions, hepatic hydroxyproline contents, and ALT activity after 14-days of BDL in both wild-type and vasohibin-1-deficient mice. There was unexpectedly no difference between these mice, suggesting that anti-fibrogenic and angiogenic activities of the endogenous vasohibin-1 might be masked in the normal liver at early stage of hepatic fibrosis in mice.},

Cholangiocellular proliferation occurred in large bile ducts on days 2-3 and in small bile ducts on day 5. Neutrophil infiltration occurred within 8 h, with neutrophils remaining the predominant immune cell type until day 3. Acute injury was followed by continuous tissue repair, lymphocyte and Kupffer cell infiltration, and accumulation of collagen during the second week. Thereafter, the number of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells and the expression of transforming growth factor beta1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and procollagen (I) decreased, and liver fibrosis stabilized.BDL elicits dynamic changes in mouse liver. The chronological dissection and quantification of these events identified specific phases of acute and chronic cholestatic liver injury.},

We have used a potent, nonsteroidal FXR ligand to show that FXR induces expression of small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP-1), an atypical member of the nuclear receptor family that lacks a DNA-binding domain. SHP-1 represses expression of CYP7A1 by inhibiting the activity of liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), an orphan nuclear receptor that is known to regulate CYP7A1 expression positively. This bile acid-activated regulatory cascade provides a molecular basis for the coordinate suppression of CYP7A1 and other genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Obstruction of the common bile duct in a variety of clinical settings leads to cholestatic liver injury. An important aspect of this injury is hepatic inflammation, with neutrophils as the prominent cell type involved. However, the pathophysiologic role of the infiltrating neutrophils during cholestatic liver injury remains unclear. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that neutrophils contribute to the overall pathophysiology by using bile duct-ligated (BDL) wild-type animals and mice deficient in the beta(2) integrin CD18. In wild-type animals, neutrophils were activated systemically as indicated by the increased expression of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and L-selectin shedding 3 days after BDL. Histologic evaluation (48 +/- 10\% necrosis) and plasma transaminase levels showed severe liver injury. Compared with sham-operated controls (< 10 neutrophils per 20 high-power fields), large numbers of neutrophils were present in livers of BDL mice (425 +/- 64). About 60\% of these neutrophils had extravasated into the parenchyma. In addition, a substantial number of extravasated neutrophils were found in the portal tract. In contrast, Mac-1 was not up-regulated and plasma transaminase activities and the area of necrosis (21 +/- 9\%) were significantly reduced in CD18-deficient animals. These mice had overall 62\% less neutrophils in the liver. In particular, extravasation from sinusoids and portal venules (PV) was reduced by 91\% and 47\%, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining for chlorotyrosine, a marker of neutrophil-derived oxidant stress, was observed in the parenchyma of BDL wild-type but not CD18-deficient mice. In conclusion, neutrophils aggravated acute cholestatic liver injury after BDL. This inflammatory injury involves CD18-dependent extravasation of neutrophils from sinusoids and reactive oxygen formation.},

An image processing program was developed with Delphi for the quantification of fibrosis in liver tissue samples stained with Sirius Red. Bile duct ligated and sham operated wild type C57BL/6 mice served as a model of time-dependent induction of liver fibrosis. Formation of fibrosis was determined with the developed software at day 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 20, 30 and 60. The results were compared to a semi-quantitative scoring system.Quantitative accumulation of collagen fibres was observed from day 3 to day 14, with a slight further increase thereafter. During ongoing fibrogenesis, there was a significant elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and bilirubin. The results from our computer-based morphometric analysis were highly correlated with the results that were obtained in a standardized pathology semi-quantitative scoring system (R 2 = 0.89, n = 38).Using our Delphi-based image analysing software, the morphometric assessment of fibrosis is as precise as semi-quantitative scoring by an experienced pathologist. This program can be a valuable tool in any kind of experimental or clinical setting for standardized quantitative assessment of fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Clustering is crucial for gene expression data analysis. As an unsupervised exploratory procedure its results can help researchers to gain insights and formulate new hypothesis about biological data from microarrays. Given different settings of microarray experiments, clustering proves itself as a versatile exploratory tool. It can help to unveil new cancer subtypes or to identify groups of genes that respond similarly to a specific experimental condition. In order to obtain useful clustering results, however, different parameters of the clustering procedure must be properly tuned. Besides the selection of the clustering method itself, determining which distance is going to be employed between data objects is probably one of the most difficult decisions.We analyze how different distances and clustering methods interact regarding their ability to cluster gene expression, i.e., microarray data. We study 15 distances along with four common clustering methods from the literature on a total of 52 gene expression microarray datasets. Distances are evaluated on a number of different scenarios including clustering of cancer tissues and genes from short time-series expression data, the two main clustering applications in gene expression. Our results support that the selection of an appropriate distance depends on the scenario in hand. Moreover, in each scenario, given the very same clustering method, significant differences in quality may arise from the selection of distinct distance measures. In fact, the selection of an appropriate distance measure can make the difference between meaningful and poor clustering outcomes, even for a suitable clustering method.},

  Abstract                 = {Cluster analysis is usually the first step adopted to unveil information from gene expression microarray data. Besides selecting a clustering algorithm, choosing an appropriate proximity measure (similarity or distance) is of great importance to achieve satisfactory clustering results. Nevertheless, up to date, there are no comprehensive guidelines concerning how to choose proximity measures for clustering microarray data. Pearson is the most used proximity measure, whereas characteristics of other ones remain unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the choice of proximity measures for the clustering of microarray data by evaluating the performance of 16 proximity measures in 52 data sets from time course and cancer experiments. Our results support that measures rarely employed in the gene expression literature can provide better results than commonly employed ones, such as Pearson, Spearman, and euclidean distance. Given that different measures stood out for time course and cancer data evaluations, their choice should be specific to each scenario. To evaluate measures on time-course data, we preprocessed and compiled 17 data sets from the microarray literature in a benchmark along with a new methodology, called Intrinsic Biological Separation Ability (IBSA). Both can be employed in future research to assess the effectiveness of new measures for gene time-course data.},

  Abstract                 = {A study has been made of sequential changes in the rat's liver from 1 to 40 days after obstruction of the common bile duct. The qualitative changes have been described and illustrated. The volume proportions of hepatocytes, bile duct epithelium and biliary stroma have been quantified by histological analysis using a point counting technique. The proliferation of hepatocytes and bile duct cells have been measured by labelling with tritiated thymidine. The absolute quantity of hepatocytes in each liver has been estimated and expressed as a percentage of body weight. Over 40 days there is a relative fall in the volume proportion of hepatocytes and an increase in bile duct cells and biliary stroma. These changes in volume proportions are related directly to the period of jaundice. Biliary stroma increases in support of new bile duct tissue and there is no excessive fibrosis. Hepatocytes proliferate at a greater rate than normal after obstruction of the common bile duct and the degree of proliferation reaches a maximum of 24 times that of normal 4 days after obstruction. Similarly, the proliferation of bile duct epithelium is increased in obstructive jaundice but in this instance it reaches a maximum of 50 times that of normal 24 h after ligation of the common bile duct. The absolute quantity of hepatocytes in the liver probably falls during the period of jaundice. However, the fall is less than anticipated from the volume proportion of hepatocytes because of the overall increase in liver size.},

  Abstract                 = {Constant intense light causes apoptosis of rod and cone photoreceptors in adult albino zebrafish. The photoreceptors subsequently regenerate from proliferating inner nuclear layer (INL) progenitor cells that migrate to the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and differentiate into rods and cones. To identify gene expression changes during this photoreceptor regeneration response, a microarray analysis was performed at five time points during the light treatment. The time course included an early time point during photoreceptor death (16 h), later time points during progenitor cell proliferation and migration (31, 51, and 68 h) and a 96 h time point, which likely corresponds to the initial photoreceptor differentiation. Mean expression values for each gene were calculated at each time point relative to the control (0 h light exposure) and statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA identified 4567 genes exhibiting significant changes in gene expression along the time course. The genes within this data set were clustered based on their temporal expression patterns and proposed functions. Quantitative real-time PCR validated the microarray expression profiles for selected genes, including stat3 whose expression increased markedly during the light exposure. Based on immunoblots, both total and activated Stat3 protein expression also increased during the light treatment. Immunolocalization of Stat3 on retinal tissue sections demonstrated increased expression in photoreceptors and Müller glia by 16 h of light exposure. Some of the Stat3-positive Müller cells expressed PCNA at 31 h, suggesting that Stat3 may play a role in signaling a subset of Müller cells to proliferate during the regeneration response.},

Throughout the experiment most of the morphological changes observed in the cannulated group were comparable to those in the ligated group. Portal inflammation and marginal bile duct proliferation were noted with the same frequency in both groups. Biliary obstruction for 15 days or more led to cirrhosis. After 28 days obstruction, five out of six cannulated rats and four out of six ligated animals respectively developed cirrhosis. The development of cirrhosis was progressive and associated with ascites. It is concluded that in the rat the morphological sequelae of long term cholestasis induced by either cannulation and obstruction or ligation of bile ducts are similar and are accompanied by cirrhosis. The advantages of this experimental model for the study of human cirrhosis are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Serum bilirubin measurements are commonly obtained for the evaluation of ill patients and to screen for liver disease in routine physical exams. An enormous research effort has identified the multiple mechanisms involved in the production and metabolism of conjugated (CB) and unconjugated bilirubin (UB). While the qualitative effects of these mechanisms are well understood, their expected quantitative influence on serum bilirubin homeostasis has received less attention. In this review, each of the steps involved in bilirubin production, metabolism, hepatic cell uptake, and excretion is quantitatively examined. We then attempt to predict the expected effect of normal and defective function on serum UB and CB levels in health and disease states including hemolysis, extra- and intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatocellular diseases (eg, cirrhosis, hepatitis), and various congenital defects in bilirubin conjugation and secretion (eg, Gilbert's, Dubin-Johnson, Crigler-Najjar, Rotor syndromes). Novel aspects of this review include: 1) quantitative estimates of the free and total UB and CB in the plasma, hepatocyte, and bile; 2) detailed discussion of the important implications of the recently recognized role of the hepatic OATP transporters in the maintenance of CB homeostasis; 3) discussion of the differences between the standard diazo assay versus chromatographic measurement of CB and UB; 4) pharmacokinetic implications of the extremely high-affinity albumin binding of UB; 5) role of the enterohepatic circulation in physiologic jaundice of newborn and fasting hyperbilirubinemia; and 6) insights concerning the clinical interpretation of bilirubin measurements.},

However, how these pathways are coordinated is poorly understood. We show here that nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 is a critical player that couples and regulates the intrahepatic and enterohepatic signals for repression of BA synthesis. Ablating Shp2 in hepatocytes suppressed signal relay from FGFR4, receptor for FGF15/19, and attenuated BA activation of FXR signaling, resulting in elevation of systemic BA levels and chronic hepatobiliary disorders in mice. Acting immediately downstream of FGFR4, Shp2 associates with FRS2α and promotes the receptor activation and signal relay to several pathways. These results elucidate a molecular mechanism for the control of BA homeostasis by Shp2 through the orchestration of multiple signals in hepatocytes.},

In 5 patients, in whom a portal catheter was inserted through the umbilical vein, the diurnal variation in systemic and portal serum bile acid concentration was studied. In patients with presumably normal liver function the fasting systemic serum bile acid concentration was 4.8+/-0.5 mumol times 1(-1), and the portal concentration was 12.9+/-1.5 mumol times 1(-1). In cholestasis and liver cirrhosis the systemic and portal bile acid concentration was substantially elevated. The bile acid concentration gradient between systemic serum, portal serum, liver tissue, and hepatic bile was 1:3:80:2600 in the patients with normal liver function. In both the cholestatic and cirrhotic condition the systemic and portal serum bile acid concentration was equilibrated. Postprandially both the systemic and portal bile acid concentration increased, but the gradient between these concentrations was unchanged. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that portal and systemic serum bile acid concentrations are determined by the intestinal absorption rate in subjects with normal liver function and by the hepatic and renal clearance capacity in cholestatic and cirrhotic conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The catabolism of cholesterol into bile acids is regulated by oxysterols and bile acids, which induce or repress transcription of the pathway's rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). The nuclear receptor LXRalpha binds oxysterols and mediates feed-forward induction. Here, we show that repression is coordinately regulated by a triumvirate of nuclear receptors, including the bile acid receptor, FXR; the promoter-specific activator, LRH-1; and the promoter-specific repressor, SHP. Feedback repression of CYP7A1 is accomplished by the binding of bile acids to FXR, which leads to transcription of SHP. Elevated SHP protein then inactivates LRH-1 by forming a heterodimeric complex that leads to promoter-specific repression of both CYP7A1 and SHP. These results reveal an elaborate autoregulatory cascade mediated by nuclear receptors for the maintenance of hepatic cholesterol catabolism.},

  Abstract                 = {Bile salts have a crucial role in hepatobiliary and intestinal homeostasis and digestion. Primary bile salts are synthesized by the liver from cholesterol, and may be modified by the intestinal flora to form secondary and tertiary bile salts. Bile salts are efficiently reabsorbed from the intestinal lumen to undergo enterohepatic circulation. In addition to their function as a surfactant involved in the absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins bile salts are potent signaling molecules in both the liver and intestine. Under physiological conditions the bile salt pool is tightly regulated, but the adaptive capacity may fall short under cholestatic conditions. Elevated serum and tissue levels of potentially toxic hydrophobic bile salts during cholestasis may cause mitochondrial damage, apoptosis or necrosis in susceptible cell types. Therapeutic nontoxic bile salts may restore impaired hepatobiliary secretion in cholestatic disorders. The hydrophilic bile salt ursodeoxycholate is today regarded as the effective standard treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and is implicated for use in various other cholestatic conditions. Novel therapeutic bile salts that are currently under evaluation may also prove valuable in the treatment of these diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette membrane transporter family, which is expressed apically in liver, kidney, and intestine epithelium. Recent reports suggest that in addition to xenobiotics, porphyrins, and food toxins, Bcrp can also transport bile acids and, therefore, may participate in the adaptive response to cholestasis. Bile duct ligation (BDL), an experimental model of obstructive cholestasis, was performed in male wild-type (WT) and Bcrp knockout (KO) mice. An initial time course of 3, 7, and 14 days of BDL in WT mice revealed that Bcrp expression was significantly reduced in liver but increased in ileum by 7 days. Subsequent experiments using 7-day BDL in WT and Bcrp KO mice demonstrated that there was no difference in liver necrosis, serum glutamic pyruvate aminotransferase, bilirubin, or bile acid levels in serum, hepatic tissue, bile, urine, or feces between the two groups. Protein expression levels for liver organic solute transporter (Ost) α and multidrug resistance protein 1 and kidney multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp) 2, Mrp3, and Mrp4 were significantly greater in the sham Bcrp KO versus sham WT mice. The expression of Mrp2 and Mrp4 in KO kidneys was further increased after BDL. In contrast, the adaptive response of transporters to BDL in the liver was similar in KO and WT BDL mice, including Ostα and Ostβ expression, which increased in liver and kidney but decreased in the ileum. These findings suggest that Bcrp does not have a significant role in the adaptive response to cholestasis in the liver but may be more important for solute export in the kidney and intestine.},

  Abstract                 = {Obstructive jaundice (OJ) is associated with increased surgical morbidity and infectious complication. The aim of the current study was to clarify the mechanism of excessive inflammation and susceptibility to infection in OJ.C57/BL6 mice were subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham surgery. Expression tumor necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, inducible protein-10, and interleukin (IL)-10, activation of nuclear factor kappa B, fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis, serum alanine aminotransferase levels, and histology were examined. Survival after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration or cecal ligation and puncture 3 or 14 d after surgery was determined. IL-1beta and interferon-gamma expression was examined after LPS administration.OJ induced nuclear factor kappa B activation and increased expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-2, which caused significant increases in neutrophil recruitment. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels increased consistent with histological observations in OJ. Mononuclear cells were recruited in the liver after BDL associated with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 up-regulation. The recruitment of NK and T cells was varied, consistent with IP-10 expression during the time course of OJ. IL-10 expression was significantly up-regulated 14 d after BDL. After LPS administration, the mice at 3 d after BDL and at 3 and 14 d after sham surgery were all still alive, but all mice at 14 d after BDL died. After LPS administration, IL-1beta significantly increased in the mice at 14 d after BDL.Immune response such as expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and recruitment of immune cells may thus differ over the time course of OJ. Prolonged OJ may cause excessive inflammation, thus result in susceptibility to infection.},

Primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis are the most commonly recognized cholestatic liver disease in the adult population, while biliary atresia and Alagille syndrome are commonly recognized in the pediatric population. In infants, the causes are usually congenital or inherited. Even though jaundice is a hallmark of cholestasis, it is not always seen in adult patients with chronic liver disease. Patients can have "silent" progressive cholestatic liver disease for years prior to development of symptoms such as jaundice and pruritus. In this review, we will discuss some of the atypical causes of cholestatic liver disease such as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, Alagille Syndrome, biliary atresia, total parenteral nutrition induced cholestasis and cholestasis secondary to drug induced liver injury.},

  Abstract                 = {Patients with decompensated cirrhosis are susceptible to infection. Innate immune dysfunction and development of organ failure are considered to underlie this. A rodent model of liver disease sharing these phenotypic features would assist in vivo study of underlying mechanisms and testing of therapeutics. We evaluated three models to identify which demonstrated the greatest clinical and immunological phenotypic similarity to patients with acutely decompensated (AD) cirrhosis.We selected Bile Duct Ligation (BDL) rats at 4 weeks, BDL mice at 14 days and Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ) mice at 10 weeks (with studies performed 7 days after final CCl4 infection). We examined organ dysfunction, inflammatory response to carrageenan-in-paw, plasma eicosanoid concentrations, macrophage cytokine production and responses to peritoneal infection.Bile duct ligation caused sarcopenia, liver, cardiovascular and renal dysfunction whereas CCl4 mice demonstrated no clinical abnormalities. BDL rodents exhibited depressed response to carrageenan-in-paw unlike CCl4 mice. BDL rats have slightly elevated plasma eicosanoid levels and plasma showed partial PGE2 -mediated immune suppression whereas CCl4 mice did not. Plasma NOx was elevated in patients with acute or chronic liver failure (AoCLF) compared to healthy volunteers and BDL rodents but not CCl4 mice. Elevated nitric oxide (NO) via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mediates defective leucocyte trafficking in BDL rodent models.We conclude that BDL mice and rats are not simply models of cholestatic liver injury but may be used to study mechanisms underlying poor outcome from infection in AD and have identified elevated NO as a potential mediator of depressed leucocyte trafficking.},

  Abstract                 = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which is a mediator of hepatotoxicity, has been implicated in liver fibrosis. However, the roles of TNF-α on hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and liver fibrosis are complicated and remain controversial. To explore this issue, the role of TNF-α in cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis was examined by comparing between TNF-α(-/-) mice and TNF-α(+/+) mice after bile duct ligation (BDL). Serum TNF-α levels in mice were increased by common BDL combined with cystic duct ligation (CBDL+CDL). TNF-α deficiency reduced liver fibrosis without affecting liver injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, and liver regeneration after CBDL+CDL. Increased expression levels of collagen α1(I) mRNA, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β mRNA, and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) protein by CBDL+CDL in the livers of TNF-α(-/-) mice were comparable to those in TNF-α(+/+) mice. Exogenous administration of TNF-α decreased collagen α1(I) mRNA expression in isolated rat HSCs. These results suggest that the reduced fibrosis in TNF-α(-/-) mice is regulated in post-transcriptional level. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. TIMP-1 expression in HSCs in the liver was increased by CBDL+CDL, and the induction was lower in TNF-α(-/-) mice than in TNF-α(+/+) mice. Fibrosis in the lobe of TIMP-1(-/-) mice with partial BDL was also reduced. These findings indicate that TNF-α produced by cholestasis can promote liver fibrosis via TIMP-1 production from HSCs. Thus, targeting TNF-α and TIMP-1 may become a new therapeutic strategy for treating liver fibrosis in cholestatic liver injury.},

  Abstract                 = {The portal area is the 'main entrance' and one of the two main exits of the liver lobule. Through the main entrance portal and arterial blood reach the liver sinusoids. Through the exit the bile flows towards the duodenum. The three main structures, portal vein and artery with their own wall (and vascular smooth muscle cells) and bile duct with its basal membrane, are surrounded by loose myofibroblasts and by the first layer of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells. Chronic diseases of the liver can lead to development of liver cirrhosis, characterized by formation of fibrotic septa which can be portal-portal in the case of the chronic biliary damage or portal-central in the case of the chronic viral hepatitis. Central-central septa can also be observed under other pathological conditions. When damaging noxae are introduced to the liver, inflammatory cells are first recruited to the portal field, the first layer of hepatocytes may be destroyed (enlargement of the portal field) and portal (myo)fibroblasts become activated. A similar reaction may take place when the target of inflammation is the bile duct with consecutive reduction of the bile flow, activation of the portal (myo)fibroblasts, proliferation of bile ducts and destruction of the hepatocytes around the portal field. Increased matrix deposition may be the consequence. During the past years several publications dealt with the pathomechanisms of portal fibrogenesis as well as with its resolution. One of the most intriguing observations was that it is not hepatic stellate cells of the hepatic sinusoid, but portal (myo)fibroblasts which rapidly acquire the phenotype of 'activated' (myo)fibroblasts in the early stages of cholestatic fibrosis. These may also become the main mesenchymal cells of the porto-portal or porto-central fibrotic septa. This article reviews the similarities as well as differences between the mesenchymal cells of the portal tract and of the fibrotic septa vs 'activated' stellate cells of the hepatic sinusoids, and discusses the debate over their relative contributions to liver fibrogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {The synthesis and excretion of bile acids comprise the major pathway of cholesterol catabolism in mammals. Synthesis provides a direct means of converting cholesterol, which is both hydrophobic and insoluble, into a water-soluble and readily excreted molecule, the bile acid. The biosynthetic steps that accomplish this transformation also confer detergent properties to the bile acid, which are exploited by the body to facilitate the secretion of cholesterol from the liver. This role in the elimination of cholesterol is counterbalanced by the ability of bile acids to solubilize dietary cholesterol and essential nutrients and to promote their delivery to the liver. The synthesis of a full complement of bile acids requires 17 enzymes. The expression of selected enzymes in the pathway is tightly regulated by nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors, which ensure a constant supply of bile acids in an ever changing metabolic environment. Inherited mutations that impair bile acid synthesis cause a spectrum of human disease; this ranges from liver failure in early childhood to progressive neuropathy in adults.},

  Abstract                 = {Cellular processes cause changes over time. Observing and measuring those changes over time allows insights into the how and why of regulation. The experimental platform for doing the appropriate large-scale experiments to obtain time-courses of expression levels is provided by microarray technology. However, the proper way of analyzing the resulting time course data is still very much an issue under investigation. The inherent time dependencies in the data suggest that clustering techniques which reflect those dependencies yield improved performance.We propose to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to account for the horizontal dependencies along the time axis in time course data and to cope with the prevalent errors and missing values. The HMMs are used within a model-based clustering framework. We are given a number of clusters, each represented by one Hidden Markov Model from a finite collection encompassing typical qualitative behavior. Then, our method finds in an iterative procedure cluster models and an assignment of data points to these models that maximizes the joint likelihood of clustering and models. Partially supervised learning--adding groups of labeled data to the initial collection of clusters--is supported. A graphical user interface allows querying an expression profile dataset for time course similar to a prototype graphically defined as a sequence of levels and durations. We also propose a heuristic approach to automate determination of the number of clusters. We evaluate the method on published yeast cell cycle and fibroblasts serum response datasets, and compare them, with favorable results, to the autoregressive curves method.},

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase that can decrease the synthesis of nitric oxide. BDL rats have higher plasma and hepatic ADMA levels, which may be due to increased hepatic protein arginine methyltransferase-1 and decreased dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase expression. BDL rats also exhibit renal and brain damage characterized by increased tissue ADMA concentrations. The increased plasma ADMA levels and multiple organ damages seen here are also observed following multiple organ failures associated with critical illness. This review discusses the dysregulation of ADMA in major organs in BDL rats and the role of increased ADMA in multiple organ damages.},

Liver injury associated with BDL for 15 days included significant reactive oxygen/nitrogen species generation, liver inflammation, cell death and fibrosis. Administration of Epigallocatechin 3-Gallate (EGCG) in animals reduced liver fibrosis involving parenchymal cells in BDL model. EGCG attenuated BDL-induced gene expression of pro-fibrotic markers (Collagen, Fibronectin, alpha 2 smooth muscle actin or SMA and connective tissue growth factor or CTGF), mitochondrial oxidative stress, cell death marker (DNA fragmentation and PARP activity), NFκB activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, MIP1α, IL1β, and MIP2). EGCG also improved BDL induced damages of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes and antioxidant defense enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and manganese superoxide dismutase. EGCG also attenuated hydrogen peroxide induced cell death in hepatocytes in vitro and alleviate stellate cells mediated fibrosis through TIMP1, SMA, Collagen 1 and Fibronectin in vitro. In conclusion, the reactive oxygen/nitrogen species generated from mitochondria plays critical pathogenetic role in the progression of liver inflammation and fibrosis and this study indicate that EGCG might be beneficial for reducing liver inflammation and fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Circulating microRNA-122 (miR-122) has been increasingly reported to be a potential biomarker for drug-, viral-, alcohol- and chemical-induced liver injury. The present study was initiated to determine the potential of circulating miR-122 as a biomarker for cholestatic liver injury.Both bile-duct ligation (BDL) mice and patients with biliary calculi were employed as cholestatic liver injury models, and serum miR-122 level was determined by stem-loop real-time reverse-transcription PCR (SLqRT-PCR). All quantitative PCR values were normalized to those for U6 RNA and calculated with the 2(-△Ct) method.Serum miR-122 increased significantly after BDL-induced cholestatic injury and showed a similar time course to ALT concentrations. Compared with the sham controls, BDL mice had increased serum levels of miR-122 by 24.36±12.86, 423.63±322.89, 4.43±2.02 and 12.23±8.92 folds after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days, respectively. Moreover, serum miR-122 level was substantially higher in patients with biliary calculi than that in the healthy control group. In addition, patients with severe liver injury showed significantly higher levels of serum miR-122 when compared with healthy controls or patients with mild or moderate liver injury. Furthermore, serum miR-122 was found to show significant diagnostic value for biliary calculi by yielding an AUC (the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.931 with 77.4\% sensitivity and 96.4\% specificity in discriminating biliary calculi from healthy controls.Collectively, these data suggest that serum miR-122 has strong potential as a novel, specific and noninvasive biomarker for diagnosis of cholestasis-induced liver injury.},

  Abstract                 = {In most vertebrates, the liver produces bile that is necessary to emulsify absorbed fats and enable the digestion of lipids in the small intestine as well as to excrete bilirubin and other metabolic products. In the liver, the experimental obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary system initiates a complex cascade of pathological events that leads to cholestasis and inflammation resulting in a strong fibrotic reaction originating from the periportal fields. Therefore, surgical ligation of the common bile duct has become the most commonly used model to induce obstructive cholestatic injury in rodents and to study the molecular and cellular events that underlie these pathophysiological mechanisms induced by inappropriate bile flow. In recent years, different surgical techniques have been described that either allow reconnection or reanastomosis after bile duct ligation (BDL), e.g., partial BDL, or other microsurgical methods for specific research questions. However, the most frequently used model is the complete obstruction of the common bile duct that induces a strong fibrotic response after 21 to 28 days. The mortality rate can be high due to infectious complications or technical inaccuracies. Here we provide a detailed surgical procedure for the BDL model in mice that induce a highly reproducible fibrotic response in accordance to the 3R rule for animal welfare postulated by Russel and Burch in 1959.},

The aim of this study was to elucidate gene expression profiling in the whole liver of bile duct ligated (BDL) rats using microarray analysis. In addition, the localization and time course of up-regulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was investigated.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The whole liver was removed from BDL and sham-operated rats at day 2 after the procedure, and microarray analysis was performed using an array on which 3757 rat cDNA clones spotted. The up-regulation of VEGF expression was investigated by RT-PCR using livers at day 1, 2, 4 and 7, and immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry at day 2.Marked proliferation of bile ducts was observed in livers of BDL rats. By microarray analysis, 38 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated transcripts were detected in whole liver of the BDL rat. The expression of VEGF-A was significantly elevated in the BDL rats at day 2; the VEGF-A/GAPDH ratio was 4.030 +/- 2.493 in BDL rats and 1.159 +/- 0.125 in sham-operated rats (P = 0.0330). The up-regulation of VEGF-A expression was maximal at day 2. Immunoblotting also demonstrated up-regulated expression of VEGF-A at the protein level. Immunostaining of VEGF revealed that the expression was evident in hepatocytes adjacent to the portal tracts, and scarcely observed in hepatocytes at the centrilobular area or cholangiocytes.Gene expression profiling in the whole liver of the BDL rats revealed 38 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated transcripts. In addition, the up-regulated expression of VEGF was mainly observed in hepatocytes surrounding to the portal tracts.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most useful experimental fibrogenesis models is the "bile duct-ligated rats". Our aim was to investigate the quantitative hepatic collagen content by two different methods during the different stages of hepatic fibrosis in bile duct-ligated rats on a weekly basis. We questioned whether the 1-wk or 4-wk bile duct-ligated model is suitable in animal fibrogenesis trials.Of the 53 male Wistar rats, 8 (Group 0) were used as a healthy control group. Bile duct ligation (BDL) had been performed in the rest. Bile duct-ligated rates were sacrificed 7 days later in group 1 (10 rats), 14 days later in group 2 (9 rats), 21 days later in group 3(9 rats) and 28 days later in group 4 (9 rats). Eight rats underwent sham-operation (Sham). Hepatic collagen measurements as well as serum levels of liver enzymes and function tests were all analysed.The peak level of collagen was observed biochemically and histomorphometricly at the end of third week (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05). Suprisingly, collagen levels had decreased with the course of time such as at the end of fourth week (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05).We have shown that fibrosis in bile duct-ligated rats is transient, i.e. reverses spontaneously after 3 weeks. This contrasts any situation in patients where hepatic fibrosis is progressive and irreversible as countless studies performed by many investigators in the same animal model.},

Genetic transporter variants contribute to an entire spectrum of cholestatic liver diseases and can cause hereditary cholestatic syndromes or determine susceptibility and disease progression in acquired cholestatic disorders. Cholestasis is associated with complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional alterations of hepatobiliary transporters and enzymes participating in bile formation. Ligand-activated nuclear receptors for bile acids and other biliary compounds play a key role in the regulation of genes required for bile formation. Pharmacological interventions in cholestasis may aim at modulating such novel regulatory pathways. This review will summarize the principles of molecular alterations in cholestasis and will give an overview of potential clinical implications.},

  Abstract                 = {Extrahepatic cholestasis leads to complex injury and repair processes that result in bile infarct formation, neutrophil infiltration, cholangiocyte and hepatocyte proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis. To identify early molecular mechanisms of injury and repair after bile duct obstruction, microarray analysis was performed on liver tissue 24 hours after bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham surgery. The most upregulated gene identified encodes plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1, Serpine 1), a protease inhibitor that blocks urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity. Because PAI-1, uPA, and tPA influence growth factor and cytokine processing as well as extracellular matrix remodeling, we evaluated the role of PAI-1 in cholestatic liver injury by comparing the injury and repair processes in wild-type (WT) and PAI-1-deficient (PAI-1-/-) mice after BDL. PAI-1-/- mice had fewer and smaller bile infarcts, less neutrophil infiltration, and higher levels of cholangiocyte and hepatocyte proliferation than WT animals after BDL. Furthermore, PAI-1-/- mice had higher levels of tPA activation and mature hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) after BDL than WT mice, suggesting that PAI-1 effects on HGF activation critically influence cholestatic liver injury. This was further supported by elevated levels of c-Met and Akt phosphorylation in PAI-1-/- mice after BDL. In conclusion, PAI-1 deficiency reduces liver injury after BDL in mice. These data suggest that inhibiting PAI-1 might attenuate liver injury in cholestatic liver diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholestasis is a pathological common component of numerous liver diseases that results in hepatotoxicity, inflammation, and cirrhosis when untreated. While the predominant hypothesis in cholestatic liver injury remains hepatocyte apoptosis due to direct toxicity of hydrophobic bile acid exposure, recent work suggests that the injury occurs through inflammatory necrosis. In order to resolve this controversy, we used novel plasma biomarkers to assess the mechanisms of cell death during early cholestatic liver injury. C57Bl/6 mice underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) for 6-72 h, or sham operation. Another group of mice were given d-galactosamine and endotoxin as a positive control for apoptosis and inflammatory necrosis. Plasma levels of full length cytokeratin-18 (FL-K18), microRNA-122 (miR-122) and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) increased progressively after BDL with peak levels observed after 48 h. These results indicate extensive cell necrosis after BDL, which is supported by the time course of plasma alanine aminotransferase activities and histology. In contrast, plasma caspase-3 activity, cleaved caspase-3 protein and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 fragments (cK18) were not elevated at any time during BDL suggesting the absence of apoptosis. In contrast, all plasma biomarkers of necrosis and apoptosis were elevated 6 h after Gal/End treatment. In addition, acetylated HMGB1, a marker for macrophage and monocyte activation, was increased as early as 12 h but mainly at 48-72 h. However, progressive neutrophil accumulation in the area of necrosis started at 6h after BDL. In conclusion, these data indicate that early cholestatic liver injury in mice is an inflammatory event, and occurs through necrosis with little evidence for apoptosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholestasis results in a buildup of bile acids in serum and in hepatocytes. Early studies into the mechanisms of cholestatic liver injury strongly implicated bile acid-induced apoptosis as the major cause of hepatocellular injury. Recent work has focused both on the role of bile acids in cell signaling as well as the role of sterile inflammation in the pathophysiology. Advances in modern analytical methodology have allowed for more accurate measuring of bile acid concentrations in serum, liver, and bile to very low levels of detection. Interestingly, toxic bile acid levels are seemingly far lower than previously hypothesized. The initial hypothesis has been based largely upon the exposure of μmol/L concentrations of toxic bile acids and bile salts to primary hepatocytes in cell culture, the possibility that in vivo bile acid concentrations may be far lower than the observed in vitro toxicity has far reaching implications in the mechanism of injury. This review will focus on both how different bile acids and different bile acid concentrations can affect hepatocytes during cholestasis, and additionally provide insight into how these data support recent hypotheses that cholestatic liver injury may not occur through direct bile acid-induced apoptosis, but may involve largely inflammatory cell-mediated liver cell necrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholestatic liver diseases can be caused by genetic defects, drug toxicities, hepatobiliary malignancies or obstruction of the biliary tract. Cholestasis leads to accumulation of bile acids (BAs) in hepatocytes. Direct toxicity of BAs is currently the most accepted hypothesis for cholestatic liver injury. However, information on which bile acids are actually accumulating during cholestasis is limited.To assess the BA composition in liver and serum after bile duct ligation (BDL) in male C57Bl/6 mice between 6 h and 14 days and evaluate toxicity of the most abundant BAs.Bile acid concentrations increased in liver (27-fold) and serum (1400-fold) within 6 h after surgery and remained elevated up to 14 days. BAs in livers of BDL mice became more hydrophilic than sham controls, mainly because of increased 6β-hydroxylation and taurine conjugation. Among the eight unconjugated and 16 conjugated BAs identified in serum and liver, only taurocholic acid (TCA), β-muricholic acid (βMCA) and TβMCA were substantially elevated representing >95\% of these BAs over the entire time course. Although glycochenodeoxycholic acid and other conjugated BAs increased in BDL animals, the changes were several orders of magnitude lower compared with TCA, βMCA and TβMCA. A mixture of these BAs did not cause apoptosis or necrosis, but induced inflammatory gene expression in cultured murine hepatocytes.The concentrations of cytotoxic BAs are insufficient to cause hepatocellular injury. In contrast, TCA, βMCA and TβMCA are able to induce pro-inflammatory mediators in hepatocytes. Thus, BAs act as inflammagens and not as cytotoxic mediators after BDL in mice.},

  Abstract                 = {Bile acid synthesis, transport and metabolism are markedly altered in experimental cholestasis. Whether such coordinated regulation exists in human cholestatic diseases is unclear. We therefore investigated expression of genes for bile acid synthesis, detoxification and alternative basolateral export and regulatory nuclear factors in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).Hepatic CYP7A1, CYP27A1, CYP8B1 (bile acid synthesis), CYP3A4 (hydroxylation), SULT2A1 (sulphation), UGT2B4/2B7 (glucuronidation), MRP4 (basolateral export), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), short heterodimer partner (SHP), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) and HNF4alpha expression was determined in 11 patients with late-stage PBC and this was compared with non-cholestatic controls.CYP7A1 mRNA was repressed in PBC to 10-20\% of controls, while CYP27 and CYP8B1 mRNA remained unchanged. SULT2A1, UGT2B4/2B7 and CYP3A4 mRNA levels were unaltered or only mildly reduced in PBC. MRP4 protein levels were induced three-fold in PBC, whereas mRNA levels remained unchanged. Expression levels of FXR, RXR, SHP, PXR, CAR, HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha were moderately reduced in PBC without reaching statistical significance.Repression of bile acid synthesis and induction of basolateral bile acid export may represent adaptive mechanisms to limit bile acid burden in chronic cholestasis. As these changes do not sufficiently counteract cholestatic liver damage, future therapeutic strategies should aim at stimulation of bile acid detoxification pathways.},
