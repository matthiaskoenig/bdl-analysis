  Abstract                 = {Gene expression profiling using RNA-seq is a powerful technique for screening RNA species' landscapes and their dynamics in an unbiased way. While several advanced methods exist for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, proper tools to anal.yze RNA-seq time-course have not been proposed.In this study, we use RNA-seq to measure gene expression during the early human T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation and T-: cell activation (Th0). To quantify Th17-: specific gene expression dynamics, we present a novel statistical methodology, DyNB, for analyzing time-course RNA-seq data. We use non-parametric Gaussian processes to model temporal correlation in gene expression and combine that with negative binomial likelihood for the count data. To account for experiment-: specific biases in gene expression dynamics, such as differences in cell differentiation efficiencies, we propose a method to rescale the dynamics between replicated measurements. We develop an MCMC sampling method to make inference of differential expression dynamics between conditions. DyNB identifies several known and novel genes involved in Th17 differentiation. Analysis of differentiation efficiencies revealed consistent patterns in gene expression dynamics between different cultures. We use qRT-PCR to validate differential expression and differentiation efficiencies for selected genes. Comparison of the results with those obtained via traditional timepoint-: wise analysis shows that time-course analysis together with time rescaling between cultures identifies differentially expressed genes which would not otherwise be detected.An implementation of the proposed computational methods will be available at http://research.ics.aalto.fi/csb/software/},

  Abstract                 = {Cirrhosis is the end result of chronic liver disease. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are believed to be the major source of collagen-producing myofibroblasts in cirrhotic livers. Portal fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived cells, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) might also contribute to the myofibroblast population in damaged livers. Fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1, also called S100A4) is considered a marker of fibroblasts in different organs undergoing tissue remodeling and is used to identify fibroblasts derived from EMT in several organs including the liver. The aim of this study was to characterize FSP1-positive cells in human and experimental liver disease. FSP1-positive cells were increased in human and mouse experimental liver injury including liver cancer. However, FSP1 was not expressed by HSC or type I collagen-producing fibroblasts. Likewise, FSP1-positive cells did not express classical myofibroblast markers, including αSMA and desmin, and were not myofibroblast precursors in injured livers as evaluated by genetic lineage tracing experiments. Surprisingly, FSP1-positive cells expressed F4/80 and other markers of the myeloid-monocytic lineage as evaluated by double immunofluorescence staining, cell fate tracking, flow cytometry, and transcriptional profiling. Similar results were obtained for bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages. FSP1-positive cells were characterized by increased expression of COX2, osteopontin, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines but reduced expression of MMP3 and TIMP3 compared with Kupffer cells/macrophages. These findings suggest that FSP1 is a marker of a specific subset of inflammatory macrophages in liver injury, fibrosis, and cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {The lack of bile flow from the liver into the intestine can have devastating complications including hepatic failure, sepsis and even death. This pathologic condition known as cholestasis can result from etiologies as diverse as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), hepatitis and pancreatic cancer. The intestinal injury associated with cholestasis has been shown to result in decreased intestinal resistance, increased bacterial translocation and increased endotoxemia. Anecdotal clinical evidence suggests a genetic predisposition to exaggerated injury. Recent animal research on two different strains of inbred mice demonstrating different rates of bacterial translocation with different mortality rates supports this premise. In this study, a microarray analysis of intestinal tissue following common bile duct ligation (CBDL) performed under general anesthesia on these same two strains of inbred mice was done with the goal of identifying the potential molecular mechanistic pathways responsible. Over 500 genes were increased more than 2.0 fold following CBDL. The most promising candidate genes included MUPs, Serpina1a and LCN-2. RT-PCR validated the microarray results for these candidate genes. In an in vitro experiment using differentiated intestinal epithelial cells, inhibition of MUP-1 by siRNA resulted in increased intestinal epithelial cell permeability. Diverse novel mechanisms involving the growth hormone pathway, the acute phase response and the innate immune response are thus potential avenues for limiting cholestatic intestinal injury. Changes in gene expression were at times found to be not only due to the CBDL but also due to the murine strain. Should further studies in cholestatic patients demonstrate inter-individual variability similar to what we have shown in mice, then a "personalized medicine" approach to cholestatic patients may become possible.},

  Abstract                 = {Inflammation contributes to liver injury during cholestasis. The mechanism by which cholestasis initiates an inflammatory response in the liver, however, is not known. Two hypotheses were investigated in the present studies. First, activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), either by bacterial lipopolysaccharide or by damage-associated molecular pattern molecules released from dead hepatocytes, triggers an inflammatory response. Second, bile acids act as inflammagens, and directly activate signaling pathways in hepatocytes that stimulate production of proinflammatory mediators. Liver inflammation was not affected in lipopolysaccharide-resistant C3H/HeJ mice after bile duct ligation, indicating that Toll-like receptor 4 is not required for initiation of inflammation. Treatment of hepatocytes with bile acids did not directly cause cell toxicity but increased the expression of numerous proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and other proteins that influence immune cell levels and function. Up-regulation of several of these genes in hepatocytes and in the liver after bile duct ligation required early growth response factor-1, but not farnesoid X receptor. In addition, early growth response factor-1 was up-regulated in the livers of patients with cholestasis and correlated with levels of inflammatory mediators. These data demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 4 is not required for the initiation of acute inflammation during cholestasis. In contrast, bile acids directly activate a signaling network in hepatocytes that promotes hepatic inflammation during cholestasis.},

  Abstract                 = {Obstructive cholestasis causes hepatic cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of liver disease are multiple and linked. We propose grouping these mechanisms according to the three phenotypes mainly expressed in the interstitial space in order to integrate them.Experimental extrahepatic cholestasis is the model most frequently used to study obstructive cholestasis. The early liver interstitial alterations described in these experimental models would produce an ischemia/reperfusion phenotype with oxidative and nitrosative stress. Then, the hyperexpression of a leukocytic phenotype, in which Kupffer cells and neutrophils participate, would induce enzymatic stress. And finally, an angiogenic phenotype, responsible for peribiliary plexus development with sinusoidal arterialization, occurs. In addition, an intense cholangiocyte proliferation, which acquires neuroendocrine abilities, stands out. This histopathological finding is also associated with fibrosis.It is proposed that the sequence of these inflammatory phenotypes, perhaps with a trophic meaning, ultimately produces a benign tumoral biliary process - although it poses severe hepatocytic insufficiency. Moreover, the persistence of this benign tumor disease would induce a higher degree of dedifferentiation and autonomy and, therefore, its malign degeneration.},

  Abstract                 = {Ectodomain shedding of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) provides negative feedback to the inflammatory loop induced by TNFα. As the significance of this mechanism in obesity-associated pathologies is unclear, we aimed to unravel how much TNFR1 ectodomain shedding controls the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as well as its role in the development of insulin resistance. We used knockin mice expressing a mutated TNFR1 ectodomain (p55(Δns)), incapable of shedding and dampen the inflammatory response. Our data show that persistent TNFα signaling through this inability of TNFR1 ectodomain shedding contributes to chronic low-grade inflammation, which is confined to the liver. In spite of this, hepatic lipid levels were not affected by the nonshedding mutation in mice fed a chow diet, nor were they worse off following 12 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) than controls (p55(+/+)) fed an HFD. We detected inflammatory infiltrates, hepatocellular necrosis, and apoptosis in livers of p55(Δns/Δns) mice fed an HFD, suggesting advanced progression of NAFLD toward nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Indeed, fibrosis was present in p55(Δns/Δns) mice, but absent in wildtype mice, confirming that the p55(Δns/Δns) mice had a more severe NASH phenotype. Despite low-grade hepatic inflammation, insulin resistance was not observed in p55(Δns/Δns) mice fed a chow diet, and HFD-induced insulin resistance was no worse in p55(Δns/Δns) mice than p55(+/+) mice.TNFR1 ectodomain shedding is not an essential feedback mechanism in preventing the development of hepatic steatosis or insulin resistance. It is, however, pivotal in attenuating the progression from "simple steatosis" towards a more serious phenotype with many NASH features. Targeting TNFR1 could therefore be beneficial in attenuating NASH.},

Genetic variations in this supergene family influence individual detoxification levels and may contribute to the development of cancer. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted to evaluate the association between GST polymorphism among Filipino patients positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV DNA) and clinically diagnosed as either with chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as normal individuals negative for HBV infection. Multiplex PCR was used to detect the presence or absence of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms in peripheral blood. DNA sequencing of the S gene region of the virus was used to determine the predominant genotype found among HBV-infected patients. Our results showed that the odds of having a chronic liver disease is only 0.95 (95\% CI 0.58-1.57) among those with GSTT1 null genotype compared to those with GSTT1+ genotype. On the other hand, the odds of chronic liver disease is 17.85 times (95\% CI 7.34-43.45) for those with GSTM1 null genotype compared to those with GSTM1+ genotype. Using the GSTT1+/GSTM1+ genotype as the reference, both GSTT1+/GSTM1- (OR 16.61; 95\% CI 6.69-41.22) and GSTT1-/GSTM1- (OR 11.91; 95\% CI 4.48-31.66) genotypes seem to be risk factors for chronic liver disease. From our observations, we conclude that polymorphism in GSTM1 null genotype (OR 17.85; 95\% CI 7.34-43.45) seem to be associated with an increased risk of chronic liver disease among Filipinos.},

Yes-associated protein (YAP), the effector of the Hippo tumor-suppressor pathway, has been shown to play a critical role in promoting cholangiocyte and hepatocyte proliferation and survival during embryonic liver development and hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether YAP participates in the regenerative response after cholestatic injury. First, we examined human liver tissue from patients with chronic cholestasis. We found more-active nuclear YAP in the bile ductular reactions of primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis patient liver samples. Next, we used the murine bile duct ligation (BDL) model to induce cholestatic liver injury. We found significant changes in YAP activity after BDL in wild-type mice. The function of YAP in the hepatic response after BDL was further evaluated with liver-specific Yap conditional deletion in mice. Ablating Yap in the mouse liver not only compromised bile duct proliferation, but also enhanced hepatocyte necrosis and suppressed hepatocyte proliferation after BDL. Furthermore, primary hepatocytes and cholangiocytes isolated from Yap-deficient livers showed reduced proliferation in response to epidermal growth factor in vitro. Finally, we demonstrated that YAP likely mediates its biological effects through the modulation of Survivin expression.Our data suggest that YAP promotes cholangiocyte and hepatocyte proliferation and prevents parenchymal damage after cholestatic injury in mice and thus may mediate the response to cholestasis-induced human liver disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an inflammation-induced cancer, which is the third-leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. We investigated the role of the chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CCR1, in regulating inflammation and tumorigenesis in an inflammation-induced HCC model in mice. Multidrug resistance 2 gene (Mdr2)-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mice spontaneously develop chronic cholestatic hepatitis and fibrosis that is eventually followed by HCC. We generated two new strains from the Mdr2-KO mouse, the Mdr2:CCR5 and the Mdr2:CCR1 double knockouts (DKOs), and set out to compare inflammation and tumorigenesis among these strains. We found that in Mdr2-KO mice lacking the chemokine receptor, CCR5 (Mdr2:CCR5 DKO mice), but not CCR1 (Mdr2:CCR1 DKO), macrophage recruitment and trafficking to the liver was significantly reduced. Furthermore, in the absence of CCR5, reduced inflammation was also associated with reduced periductal accumulation of CD24(+) oval cells and abrogation of fibrosis. DKO mice for Mdr2 and CCR5 exhibited a significant decrease in tumor incidence and size.Our results indicate that CCR5 has a critical role in both the development and progression of liver cancer. Therefore, we propose that a CCR5 antagonist can serve for HCC cancer prevention and treatment.},

However, when analyzing these experiments researchers face many new computational challenges. Algorithms that are specifically designed for time series experiments are required so that we can take advantage of their unique features (such as the ability to infer causality from the temporal response pattern) and address the unique problems they raise (e.g. handling the different non-uniform sampling rates).We present a comprehensive review of the current research in time series expression data analysis. We divide the computational challenges into four analysis levels: experimental design, data analysis, pattern recognition and networks. For each of these levels, we discuss computational and biological problems at that level and point out some of the methods that have been proposed to deal with these issues. Many open problems in all these levels are discussed. This review is intended to serve as both, a point of reference for experimental biologists looking for practical solutions for analyzing their data, and a starting point for computer scientists interested in working on the computational problems related to time series expression analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The morphological interpretation of histologic sections forms the basis of diagnosis and prognostication for cancer. In the diagnosis of carcinomas, pathologists perform a semiquantitative analysis of a small set of morphological features to determine the cancer's histologic grade. Physicians use histologic grade to inform their assessment of a carcinoma's aggressiveness and a patient's prognosis. Nevertheless, the determination of grade in breast cancer examines only a small set of morphological features of breast cancer epithelial cells, which has been largely unchanged since the 1920s. A comprehensive analysis of automatically quantitated morphological features could identify characteristics of prognostic relevance and provide an accurate and reproducible means for assessing prognosis from microscopic image data. We developed the C-Path (Computational Pathologist) system to measure a rich quantitative feature set from the breast cancer epithelium and stroma (6642 features), including both standard morphometric descriptors of image objects and higher-level contextual, relational, and global image features. These measurements were used to construct a prognostic model. We applied the C-Path system to microscopic images from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients [from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) cohort, n = 248, and the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) cohort, n = 328]. The prognostic model score generated by our system was strongly associated with overall survival in both the NKI and the VGH cohorts (both log-rank P ≤ 0.001). This association was independent of clinical, pathological, and molecular factors. Three stromal features were significantly associated with survival, and this association was stronger than the association of survival with epithelial characteristics in the model. These findings implicate stromal morphologic structure as a previously unrecognized prognostic determinant for breast cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholestasis is an impairment of bile formation/flow at the level of the hepatocyte and/or cholangiocyte. The first, and for the moment, most established medical treatment is the natural bile acid (BA) ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). This secretagogue improves, e.g. in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy or early stage primary biliary cirrhosis, impaired hepatocellular and cholangiocellular bile formation mainly by complex post-transcriptional mechanisms. The limited efficacy of UDCA in various cholestatic conditions urges for development of novel therapeutic approaches. These include nuclear and membrane receptor agonists and BA derivatives. The nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and pregnane X receptor (PXR) are transcriptional modifiers of bile formation and at present are under investigation as promising targets for therapeutic interventions in cholestatic disorders. The membrane receptors fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and apical sodium BA transporter (ASBT) deserve attention as additional therapeutic targets, as does the potential therapeutic agent norUDCA, a 23-C homologue of UDCA. Here, we provide an overview on established and future promising therapeutic agents and their potential molecular mechanisms and sites of action in cholestatic diseases.},

The expression of Notch3 and myoﬁbroblastic marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen I in HSC-T6 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-N3ICD or control vector were detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, effects of Notch3 knockdown in HSC-T6 by Notch3 siRNA were investigated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining.The expression of Notch3 was significantly up-regulated in fibrotic liver tissues of patients with chronic active hepatitis, but not detected in normal liver tissues. Active Notch signaling was found in HSC-T6 cells. TGF-β1 treatment led to up-regulation of Notch3 expression in HSC-T6 cells, and over-expression of Notch3 increased the expression of α-SMA and collagen I in HSC-T6 without TGF-β1 treatment. Interestingly, transient knockdown of Notch3 decreased the expression of myoﬁbroblastic marker and antagonized TGF-β1-induced expression of α-SMA and collagen I in HSC-T6.Notch3 may regulate the activation of HSCs, and the selective interruption of Notch3 may provide an anti-ﬁbrotic strategy in hepatic ﬁbrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Bile acids are physiological detergents that generate bile flow and facilitate intestinal absorption and transport of lipids, nutrients, and vitamins. Bile acids also are signaling molecules and inflammatory agents that rapidly activate nuclear receptors and cell signaling pathways that regulate lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism. The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids exerts important physiological functions not only in feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis but also in control of whole-body lipid homeostasis. In the liver, bile acids activate a nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), that induces an atypical nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner, which subsequently inhibits nuclear receptors, liver-related homolog-1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha and results in inhibiting transcription of the critical regulatory gene in bile acid synthesis, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). In the intestine, FXR induces an intestinal hormone, fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15; or FGF19 in human), which activates hepatic FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) signaling to inhibit bile acid synthesis. However, the mechanism by which FXR/FGF19/FGFR4 signaling inhibits CYP7A1 remains unknown. Bile acids are able to induce FGF19 in human hepatocytes, and the FGF19 autocrine pathway may exist in the human livers. Bile acids and bile acid receptors are therapeutic targets for development of drugs for treatment of cholestatic liver diseases, fatty liver diseases, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.},

Also serum level of CTGF was found as an independent predictor of histological fibrosis stage in patients with NAFLD (β = 0.662, t=5.6, P <0.001). The area under the ROC curve was estimated 0.931 to separate patients with severe fibrosis from patients with other fibrotic stages.Serum levels of CTGF may be a clinical utility for distinguishing NAFLD patients with and without advanced fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The liver has a unique and extraordinary capacity for regeneration, even in adult organisms. This regenerative potential has traditionally been attributed to the replicative capabilities of mature hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, though emerging evidence suggests that other resident liver cell types such as progenitors, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and hepatic stellate cells respond to liver injury and contribute to repair. These other cells types are also associated with liver scarring, dysfunction, and carcinogenesis, which suggests that appropriate regulation of these cells is a major determinant of response to liver injury. The Reviews in this series explore possible contributions of liver progenitor cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and hepatic stellate cells to liver homeostasis and repair and highlight how these processes can go awry in chronic liver injury, fibrosis, and liver cancer.},

Here we evaluate whether these tissue-protective effects are caused by DPO induced regulation of hepatobiliary transporters.C57BL/6J mice underwent common bile duct ligation and were treated with either DPO or physiological saline. Time dependent (2, 5, 14, 28 days after bile duct ligation) protein expression of different hepatobiliary transporters which have been established to play an important role in hepatocellular (i) bile acid uptake, (ii) bile acid excretion, and (iii) retrograde bile acid efflux were assessed. mRNA and protein expression of Lhx2, an important negative regulator of hepatic stellate cell activation, was determined.Saline treated cholestatic mice impress with increased mRNA expression of Lhx2 as a defense mechanism, while there is less need for such an upregulation in mice treated with DPO. Whereas Ntcp (slc10a1) protein expression is suppressed as early as 2 days after bile duct ligation to 40\% in untreated animals, DPO treated mice exhibit decreased protein level not before day 5. Similarly, the steady decline of Mrp4 (abcc4) protein level during extrahepatic cholestasis in control treated animals does not occur upon DPO application.The collected data show that DPO affects expression of hepatobilliary transporters during obstructive cholestasis but do not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a direct correlation between this regulation and hepatoprotection by DPO.},

Development of NASH and its progression to fibrosis is partially due to cytokines and adipokines produced by WAT. The aim of this study was to assess the association of hepatic fibrosis and NASH by evaluating the intrinsic differences in the inflammatory cytokine signaling in the visceral adipose tissue obtained from morbidly obese patients.We used targeted microarrays representing human genes involved in the inflammatory and fibrogenic reactions to profile visceral adipose samples of 15 well-matched NASH patients with and without fibrosis. Additionally, visceral adipose samples were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction profiling of 84 inflammations related genes.Eight genes (CCL2, CCL4, CCL18, CCR1, IL10RB, IL15RA, and LTB) were differentially expressed in NASH with fibrosis. Additionally, an overlapping but distinct list of the differentially expressed genes were found in NASH with type II diabetes (DM; IL8, BLR1, IL2RA, CD40LG, IL1RN, IL15RA, and CCL4) as compared to NASH without DM.Inflammatory cytokines are differentially expressed in the adipose tissue of NASH with fibrosis, as well in NASH with DM. These findings point at the interaction of adipose inflammatory cytokines, DM, hepatic fibrosis in NASH, and its progression to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Alterations in apical junctional complexes (AJCs) have been reported in genetic or acquired biliary diseases. The vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR), predominantly expressed in biliary epithelial cells in the liver, has been shown to regulate AJCs. The aim of our study was thus to investigate the role of VDR in the maintenance of bile duct integrity in mice challenged with biliary-type liver injury. Vdr(-/-) mice subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) displayed increased liver damage compared to wildtype BDL mice. Adaptation to cholestasis, ascertained by expression of genes involved in bile acid metabolism and tissue repair, was limited in Vdr(-/-) BDL mice. Furthermore, evaluation of Vdr(-/-) BDL mouse liver tissue sections indicated altered E-cadherin staining associated with increased bile duct rupture. Total liver protein analysis revealed that a truncated form of E-cadherin was present in higher amounts in Vdr(-/-) mice subjected to BDL compared to wildtype BDL mice. Truncated E-cadherin was also associated with loss of cell adhesion in biliary epithelial cells silenced for VDR. In these cells, E-cadherin cleavage occurred together with calpain 1 activation and was prevented by the silencing of calpain 1. Furthermore, VDR deficiency led to the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, while EGFR activation by EGF induced both calpain 1 activation and E-cadherin cleavage in these cells. Finally, truncation of E-cadherin was blunted when EGFR signaling was inhibited in VDR-silenced cells.Biliary-type liver injury is exacerbated in Vdr(-/-) mice by limited adaptive response and increased bile duct rupture. These results indicate that loss of VDR restricts the adaptation to cholestasis and diminishes bile duct integrity in the setting of biliary-type liver injury.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) has long been investigated in patients with cirrhosis, the question whether liver dysfunction impairs the response to CYP inducers still remains unresolved. Moreover, the mechanism underlying the possible effect of cirrhosis on induction has not been investigated. Since ethical constraints do not permit methodologically rigorous studies in humans, this question was addressed by investigating the effect of the prototypical inducer benzo[a]pyrene (BP) on CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in cirrhotic rats stratified according to the severity of liver dysfunction. We simultaneously assessed mRNA level, protein expression and enzymatic activity of the CYP1A enzymes, as well as mRNA and protein expressions of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which mediates the BP effect. Basal mRNA and protein expressions of CYP1A1 were virtually absent in both healthy and cirrhotic rats. On the contrary, CYP1A2 mRNA, protein and enzyme activity were constitutively present in healthy rats and decreased significantly as liver function worsened. BP treatment markedly increased the concentrations of mRNA and immunodetectable protein, and the enzymatic activities of both CYP1A enzymes to similar levels in healthy and non-ascitic cirrhotic rats. Induced mRNA levels, protein expressions and enzymatic activities of both CYPs were much lower in ascitic rats and were proportionally reduced. Both constitutive and induced protein expressions of AhR were significantly lower in ascitic than in healthy rats. These results indicate that the inducibility of CYP1A enzymes is well preserved in compensated cirrhosis, whereas it is markedly reduced when liver dysfunction becomes severe. Induction appears to be impaired at the transcriptional level, due to the reduced expression of AhR, which controls the transcription of CYP1A genes.},

  Abstract                 = {The action of three matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 72- and 95-kDa gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and PUMP (MMP-7), and a cysteine proteinase, cathepsin B, were investigated on aggrecan the major proteoglycan of cartilage. All the enzymes cleaved aggrecan although the activity of the 95-kDa gelatinase was very low. Specific cleavage sites were investigated following incubation with a purified aggrecan G1-G2 domain fragment (150 kDa). Both gelatinases produced 110-kDa G2 and 56-kDa G1 products by a single cleavage at an Asn-Phe bond within the interglobular domain close to the G1 domain. This was similar to the action of stromelysin (MMP-3) (Fosang, A. J., Neame, P. J., Hardingham, T. E., Murphy, G., and Hamilton, J. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15579-15582). Cathepsin B also produced two fragments from a single cleavage at a Gly-Val bond only three amino acids C-terminal to the metalloproteinase cleavage site. PUMP cleaved at the metalloproteinase Asn-Phe site, but in addition produced a low yield of a smaller G2 fragment (56 kDa) corresponding to cleavage between Asp441 and Leu442 (human sequence), within the interglobular domain, close to the G2 domain. The apparent difference in size between the two G2 fragments released by PUMP (110 and 56 kDa) was much greater than predicted from the peptide length between the cleavage sites (100 amino acids). However, keratanase digestion greatly reduced the size of the 110-kDa G2 fragment, while producing only a small reduction in size of the 56-kDa product, showing that there was approximately 30-40 kDa of keratan sulfate attached to the interglobular domain between the PUMP cleavage sites. This new structural information on aggrecan may account for the previously observed stiffness of the interglobular domains when viewed by rotary shadowing electron microscopy (Paulsson, M., Morgelin, M., Wiedemann, H., Beardmore-Gray, M., Dunham, D. G., Hardingham, T. E., Heinegard, D., Timpl, R., and Engel, J. (1987) Biochem. J. 245, 763-772). These results show that in spite of a high keratan sulfate content the interglobular domain provides important sites for cleavage by different proteinases, including several members of the matrix metalloproteinase family.},

Chronic liver injury also leads to hepatic stellate cell (HSC) differentiation and a novel subpopulation of HSCs which express CD133 and exhibit properties of progenitor cells has been described in rats. The carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced mouse model has been historically relied upon to study liver injury and regeneration. We exposed mice to CCl4 to assess whether EGF and CD133+ HSCs are up-regulated in chronically injured liver.CCl4 in olive oil was administered to strain A/J mice three times per week by oral gavage.Multiple well-differentiated HCCs were found in all livers after 15 weeks of CCl4 treatment. Notably, HCCs developed within the setting of fibrosis and not cirrhosis. CD133 was dramatically up-regulated after CCl4 treatment, and increased expression of desmin and glial fibrillary acidic protein, representative markers of HSCs, was also observed. EGF expression significantly decreased, contrary to observations in humans, whereas the expression of amphiregulin, another EGFR ligand, was significantly increased.Species-specific differences exist with respect to the histopathological and molecular pathogenesis of chronic liver disease. CCl4-induced chronic liver injury in A/J mice has important differences compared to human cirrhosis leading to HCC.},

In another group of rats, bile duct obstruction was followed by internal biliary drainage after releasing the tape. The expression of various CYP isozyme mRNAs was semi-quantitatively assessed by competitive RT-PCR.The total CYP content and microsomal MFO activity showed a significant decrease after biliary obstruction, but returned to respective control levels after biliary drainage. A marked reduction in the expression of CYP1A2, 2B1/2, 2C11, 2E1, 3A1, and 3A2 mRNA was detected during biliary obstruction, while expression increased significantly toward the control level after biliary drainage. Although expression of CYP4A1 mRNA showed no reduction during biliary obstruction, it still increased significantly after biliary drainage.These results suggest that not only obstructive jaundice, but also the subsequent internal biliary drainage may affect regulatory medications of the synthesis of individual CYP isozymes differently.},

Overexpression of exogenous vasohibin-1, a feedback inhibitor of angiogenesis, has been reported to reduce liver fibrosis after bile duct ligation (BDL). To uncover the function of endogenous vasohibin-1, we performed BDL using vasohibin-1-deficient mice and analyzed liver fibrosis, injury, and angiogenesis. Liver fibrosis was induced by 14-days of BDL in both wild-type and vasohibin-1-deficient mice. The liver sections were stained with anti-CD31 to visualize endothelial cells and with Sirius red to observe fibrotic regions. Total RNAs were purified from the livers and expression of collagen I α1 mRNA was measured by quantitative PCR. Plasma ALT activity was determined to assess liver injury. Surprisingly, the same extents of increases were seen in anti-CD31 and Sirius red stainings, collagen I α1 mRNA expressions, hepatic hydroxyproline contents, and ALT activity after 14-days of BDL in both wild-type and vasohibin-1-deficient mice. There was unexpectedly no difference between these mice, suggesting that anti-fibrogenic and angiogenic activities of the endogenous vasohibin-1 might be masked in the normal liver at early stage of hepatic fibrosis in mice.},

  Abstract                 = {Although nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is conventionally assessed histologically for lobular features of inflammation, development of portal fibrosis appears to be associated with disease progression. We investigated the composition of the portal inflammatory infiltrate and its relationship to the ductular reaction (DR), a second portal phenomenon implicated in fibrogenesis. The portal inflammatory infiltrate may contribute directly to fibrogenesis as well as influence the fate of the DR hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs), regulating the balance between liver repair and fibrosis. The presence of portal inflammation in NAFLD was strongly correlated with disease severity (fibrosis stage) and the DR. The portal infiltrate was characterized by immunostaining NAFLD liver biopsy sections (n = 33) for broad leukocyte subset markers (CD68, CD3, CD8, CD4, CD20, and neutrophil elastase) and selected inflammatory markers (matrix metalloproteinase 9 and interleukin [IL]-17). Cells expressing all markers examined were identified throughout the liver lobules and in portal tracts, although portal tracts were more densely populated (P < 0.01), and dominated by CD68(+) macrophages and CD8(+) lymphocytes, at all stages of disease. An increase in portal macrophages in NAFLD patients with steatosis alone (P < 0.01) was the earliest change detected, even before elevated expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL1B and TNF, in patients with early NASH (P < 0.05). Portal and periductal accumulation of all other cell types examined occurred in progressed NASH (all P < 0.05).Knowledge of the complex cellular composition of the portal inflammatory infiltrate and HPC/DR niche in NAFLD will shape future functional studies to elucidate the contribution of portal inflammation to HPC differentiation and NAFLD pathogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Upon tissue injury, the liver mounts a potent reparative and regenerative response. A role for proteases, including serine and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in this process is increasingly recognized. We have evaluated the expression and function of MMP10 (stromelysin-2) in liver wound healing and regeneration.The hepatic expression of MMP10 was examined in two murine models: liver regeneration after two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) and bile duct ligation (BDL). MMP10 was detected in liver tissues by qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The effect of growth factors and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonists on MMP10 expression was studied in cultured parenchymal and biliary epithelial cells and macrophages respectively. The role of MMP10 was evaluated by comparing the response of Mmp10+/+ and Mmp10-/- mice to PH and BDL. The intrahepatic turnover of the extracellular matrix proteins fibrin (ogen) and fibronectin was examined.MMP10 mRNA was readily induced after PH and BDL. MMP10 protein was detected in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and macrophages. In cultured liver epithelial cells, MMP10 expression was additively induced by transforming growth factor-β and epidermal growth factor receptor ligands. TLR4 ligands also stimulated MMP10 expression in macrophages. Lack of MMP10 resulted in increased liver injury upon PH and BDL. Resolution of necrotic areas was impaired, and Mmp10-/- mice showed increased fibrogenesis and defective turnover of fibrin (ogen) and fibronectin.MMP10 expression is induced during mouse liver injury and participates in the hepatic wound healing response. The profibrinolytic activity of MMP10 may be essential in this novel hepatoprotective role.},

  Abstract                 = {The characterization of mice models of portal hypertension (PHT) is lacking in the literature. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to make a histological approach during development of PHT in two models of cirrhosis with PHT compared with one model of isolated PHT. The model of isolated PHT was developed by partial portal vein ligation (PPVL). Two portal hypertensive cirrhotic mice models were developed either by common bile duct ligation (CBDL) or administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) subcutaneously (twice weekly, 1 ml/kg). These models represent, respectively, a secondary biliary cirrhosis and alcoholic cirrhosis. Mice were killed at several time points to evaluate liver changes by histological and ultrastructural methods. A correlation was made with portal pressure measurements. Histology revealed the absence of fibrosis or cirrhosis in PPVL mice. They developed an isolated portal hypertension. After CBDL induction, the mice developed the characteristics of cirrhosis after 6 weeks, with simultaneous increase in portal pressures. Fifty percent of the mice had ascites at that time point. Sixteen weeks after administration of CCl(4), a micronodular cirrhotic aspect of the liver was seen associated with signs of portal hypertension. This is the first descriptive study of three widely used animal models in mice, allowing the study of pathophysiological changes in cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The PPVL in mice leads to a model of isolated portal hypertension. Secondary biliary cirrhosis developed after 6 weeks of common bile duct ligation in 50\% of the mice that developed ascites. Subcutaneous injection of CCl(4) for 16 weeks induces cirrhosis and portal hypertension, without ascites. Moreover, the present study is the first description of a cirrhotic model in mice developed by subcutaneous injections of CCl(4). Well-described mice models will facilitate use of knock-out or transgenic mice and lead to a better understanding of the underlying molecular pathways in the field of portal hypertension and cirrhosis.},

Cholangiocellular proliferation occurred in large bile ducts on days 2-3 and in small bile ducts on day 5. Neutrophil infiltration occurred within 8 h, with neutrophils remaining the predominant immune cell type until day 3. Acute injury was followed by continuous tissue repair, lymphocyte and Kupffer cell infiltration, and accumulation of collagen during the second week. Thereafter, the number of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells and the expression of transforming growth factor beta1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and procollagen (I) decreased, and liver fibrosis stabilized.BDL elicits dynamic changes in mouse liver.

We have used a potent, nonsteroidal FXR ligand to show that FXR induces expression of small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP-1), an atypical member of the nuclear receptor family that lacks a DNA-binding domain. SHP-1 represses expression of CYP7A1 by inhibiting the activity of liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), an orphan nuclear receptor that is known to regulate CYP7A1 expression positively. This bile acid-activated regulatory cascade provides a molecular basis for the coordinate suppression of CYP7A1 and other genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis.},

In addition to its fibrogenic action leading to transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells into myofibroblasts, TGF-beta is also an important negative regulator of proliferation and an inducer of apoptosis. The major portion of TGF-beta is secreted as part of an inactive complex and the details of the activation process in liver have not yet been elucidated. The initially striking simplicity of the core TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathways is rapidly giving way to a much more complex view of intracellular signal transduction mechanisms and recent work has demonstrated the importance of cross-talk among different signaling pathways to either specify, enhance, or inhibit TGF-beta responses. The ubiquitous pathophysiologic relevance of TGF-beta suggests its measurement in blood as a diagnostic tool. Other strategies aim at inhibition of TGF-beta1 function or synthesis as a primary target for the development of antifibrotic strategies and recent advances in cell biology have opened several ways to approach the inhibition of TGF-beta action.},

  Abstract                 = {Still a challenging medical problem is the non-invasive monitoring of patients with a variety of chronic liver diseases being on risk to develop fibrosis, cirrhosis, and, finally, primary liver cell carcinoma. Previously, we have shown that CTGF/CCN2, a down-stream mediator of TGF-β, in serum might be a promising non-invasive biomarker of fibrosis, which is extended in the following study to cirrhosis and liver cell carcinoma. Healthy individuals (n=56), as well as fibrotic (n=77), cirrhotic (n=17), and HCC-patients (n=72) with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection, clinically, biochemically and histopathologically well characterized and classified, were included for the measurements of CTGF-concentrations in serum using a newly developed CTGF-enzyme immunoassay. A statistical significant increase of the mean serum CTGF-concentrations was associated with different stages of fibrosis, ranging from 15.9 μg/L (S0), 20.3 μg/L (S1/2) to 36.9 μg/L (S3/4). The highest CTGF-concentrations were measured in cirrhotic patients (43.6 μg/L), compared to healthy subjects (17.7 μg/L), followed by a decrease in cirrhotic HCC-patients (38.5 μg/L; p=0.001). Of note, HCC patients without underlying cirrhosis (n=8) had CTGF levels (13.5±13.2 μg/L) comparable to those in healthy controls. No statistical relation between CTGF levels and parameters of liver injury (e.g. AST, ALT) was noticed, but CTGF levels are correlated negatively with serum albumin levels (p=0.007) and platelet counts (p=0.0032), respectively. The latter was negatively correlated with the stage of fibrosis (p=0.025). In HCC patients, CTGF concentrations decreased with tumor progression and size, with lower levels in TNM stage II (30.5 μg/L) and stage III (33.6 μg/L) compared to TNM stage I (41.6 μg/L). Our data suggest a valuable diagnostic impact of CTGF in serum for the follow-up of patients suffering from chronic liver diseases developing fibrosis, cirrhosis and finally HCC. CTGF serum levels in HCC are most likely due to underlying fibrosis/cirrhosis but not due to malignancy per se.},

  Abstract                 = {Obstruction of the common bile duct in a variety of clinical settings leads to cholestatic liver injury. An important aspect of this injury is hepatic inflammation, with neutrophils as the prominent cell type involved. However, the pathophysiologic role of the infiltrating neutrophils during cholestatic liver injury remains unclear. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that neutrophils contribute to the overall pathophysiology by using bile duct-ligated (BDL) wild-type animals and mice deficient in the beta(2) integrin CD18. In wild-type animals, neutrophils were activated systemically as indicated by the increased expression of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and L-selectin shedding 3 days after BDL. Histologic evaluation (48 +/- 10\% necrosis) and plasma transaminase levels showed severe liver injury. Compared with sham-operated controls (< 10 neutrophils per 20 high-power fields), large numbers of neutrophils were present in livers of BDL mice (425 +/- 64). About 60\% of these neutrophils had extravasated into the parenchyma. In addition, a substantial number of extravasated neutrophils were found in the portal tract. In contrast, Mac-1 was not up-regulated and plasma transaminase activities and the area of necrosis (21 +/- 9\%) were significantly reduced in CD18-deficient animals. These mice had overall 62\% less neutrophils in the liver. In particular, extravasation from sinusoids and portal venules (PV) was reduced by 91\% and 47\%, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining for chlorotyrosine, a marker of neutrophil-derived oxidant stress, was observed in the parenchyma of BDL wild-type but not CD18-deficient mice. In conclusion, neutrophils aggravated acute cholestatic liver injury after BDL. This inflammatory injury involves CD18-dependent extravasation of neutrophils from sinusoids and reactive oxygen formation.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the neutral pathway of bile acid biosynthesis, is feedback-inhibited at the transcriptional level by hydrophobic bile acids. Recent studies show that bile acids are physiological ligands for farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Activated FXR indirectly represses CYP7A1 transcription through induction of small heterodimer protein (SHP-1). In this study, we provide evidence that bile acids rapidly down-regulate CYP7A1 transcription via activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SHP-1 is also a direct target of activated c-Jun. In primary rat hepatocyte cultures, taurocholate (TCA) strongly activated JNK in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a potent activator of JNK, also rapidly activated JNK and down-regulated CYP7A1 mRNA levels. Overexpression of dominant-negative JNK1 or a transactivating domain mutant of c-Jun significantly blocked the ability of TCA to down-regulate CYP7A1 mRNA. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type c-Jun (c-Jun(wt)) enhanced the repression of CYP7A1 by TCA. Moreover, overexpression of c-Jun(wt) resulted in increased SHP-1 promoter activity. Mutation of a putative AP-1 (c-Jun) element suppressed c-Jun-mediated activation of the SHP-1 promoter construct. These results indicate that the bile acid-activated JNK pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating CYP7A1 levels in primary rat hepatocytes.},

However, the role of IL-17 in liver fibrosis has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of IL-17 on cholestatic liver fibrosis.IL-17A knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to bile duct ligation. Animals were sacrificed at designated times, and serum and liver tissues were collected. The mRNA expression of hepatic fibrotic markers was assessed, and distribution of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was determined by immunohistochemical staining. In an in vitro study, Kupffer cells (KCs) and HSCs were isolated from WT mice. KCs were cultured with IL-17A or IL-17F, and production of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) was measured. HSCs were cultured with IL-17A or IL-17F, and morphologic changes were assessed by immunohistochemical staining.Liver damage observed in the WT mice was significantly improved in the KO mice. Serum TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels were significantly decreased in the KO compared with the WT mice. The hepatic mRNA expression of TNF-α, TGF-β1, and collagen 1α1, which increased in the WT mice, also significantly decreased in the KO mice. Increased hepatic fibrosis in the WT mice was significantly improved in the KO mice. Cytokine production was increased in IL-17A-treated KCs. The most remarkable myofibroblast-like changes were observed in isolated HSCs in the presence of IL-17A.IL-17A was involved in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver fibrosis by activation of both the KCs and HSCs.},

In this study, we provide evidence that CHOP up-regulates the IL-6 transcription without binding to the IL-6 promoter. CHOP dimerized more preferentially with an inhibitory isoform of nuclear factor for IL-6 expression (LIP (liver-enriched inhibitory protein)) than with a positively acting isoform (LAP, liver-enriched activator protein).

We here aimed to investigate the effects of the CC chemokine CCL3, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, in two different fibrosis models. To this end, we treated mice either with carbon tetrachloride or with a methionine- and choline-deficient diet to induce fibrosis in CCL3 deficient and wild-type mice. The results show that the protein expression of CCL3 is increased in wild-type mice after chronic liver injury. Deletion of CCL3 exhibited reduced liver fibrosis compared to their wild-type counterparts. We could validate these results by treating the two mouse groups with either carbon tetrachloride or by feeding a methionine- and choline-deficient diet. In these models, lack of CCL3 is functionally associated with reduced stellate cell activation and liver immune cell infiltration. In vitro, we show that CCL3 leads to increased proliferation and migration of hepatic stellate cells. In conclusion, our results define the chemokine CCL3 as a mediator of experimental liver fibrosis. Thus, therapeutic modulation of CCL3 might be a promising target for chronic liver diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholestatic liver disorders are caused by genetic defects, mechanical aberrations, toxins, or dysregulations in the immune system that damage the bile ducts and cause accumulation of bile and liver tissue damage. They have common clinical manifestations and pathogenic features that include the responses of cholangiocytes and hepatocytes to injury. We review the features of bile acid transport, tissue repair and regulation, apoptosis, vascular supply, immune regulation, and cholangiocytes that are associated with cholestatic liver disorders. We now have a greater understanding of the physiology of cholangiocytes at the cellular and molecular levels, as well as genetic factors, repair pathways, and autoimmunity mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of disease. These discoveries will hopefully lead to new therapeutic approaches for patients with cholestatic liver disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Liver cirrhosis is caused by iterative cycles of tissue injury, inflammation, and repair. Although most causes of acute hepatitis resolve without scarring, chronic hepatitis is associated with persistent inflammation and matrix remodeling, which leads to fibrosis and, eventually, cirrhosis. The mechanisms that govern wound healing involve interactions between the innate and adaptive immune systems and stromal cells within a microenvironment composed of cytokines, growth factors, and modified matricellular proteins. The immune system plays a central role in the regulation of fibrosis, tissue repair, and recovery that is vital for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Chronic inflammation and fibrosis are inextricably linked and the cellular interactions between immune effector cells, local fibroblasts, and tissue macrophages at sites of scar formation determine the outcome of liver injury and the development of scarring.},

  Abstract                 = {1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in numerous types of tumors. We aimed to examine the mRNA and protein expression of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-inactivating CYP24A1 and mRNA expression of the activating CYP27B1 enzymes, as well as that of vitamin D receptor (VDR), in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell cultures in response to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) administration.Increasing amounts of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (0.256-10 nM) were added to cultures of HepG2, Huh-Neo, Hep3B, Huh5-15 human HCC cell lines and cells then incubated for various time periods (30 min-28 h). The mRNA expression was analyzed by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CYP24A1 protein in HepG2 cells was detected by immuncytochemistry.CYP24A1 mRNA expression significantly (p<0.0001) increased in response to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) administration in two cell lines: in HepG2 cells, the CYP24A1 mRNA level exhibited 5,300-fold elevation, reaching a maximum value at 8 h; in Huh-Neo cells, the increase was 152-fold that of the baseline value, with the maximum being reached at 14 h. There was no significant change in Hep3B and Huh5-15 cell lines, nor was there any change in CYP27B1 and VDR gene expression in any cell cultures. Immuncytochemistry in HepG2 cells proved that gene activation was followed by CYP24A1 protein synthesis.Our novel data indicate that administration of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) results in a marked increase of CYP24A1 mRNA expression in some, but not all, human HCC lines in vitro. These differences could be dependent upon the origin of the tumor cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Bilirubin clearance is one of the numerous important functions of the liver. Defects in this process result in jaundice, which is particularly common in neonates. Elevated bilirubin levels can be decreased by treatment with phenobarbital. Because the nuclear hormone receptor constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) mediates hepatic effects of this xenobiotic inducer, we hypothesized that CAR could be a regulator of bilirubin clearance. Activation of the nuclear hormone receptor CAR increases hepatic expression of each of five components of the bilirubin-clearance pathway. This induction is absent in homozygous CAR null mice but is observed in mice expressing human CAR instead of mouse CAR. Pretreatment with xenobiotic inducers markedly increases the rate of clearance of an exogenous bilirubin load in wild-type but not CAR knockout animals. Bilirubin itself can also activate CAR, and mice lacking CAR are defective in clearing chronically elevated bilirubin levels. Unexpectedly, CAR expression is very low in livers of neonatal mice and humans. We conclude that CAR directs a protective response to elevated bilirubin levels and suggest that a functional deficit of CAR activity may contribute to neonatal jaundice.},

An image processing program was developed with Delphi for the quantification of fibrosis in liver tissue samples stained with Sirius Red. Bile duct ligated and sham operated wild type C57BL/6 mice served as a model of time-dependent induction of liver fibrosis. Formation of fibrosis was determined with the developed software at day 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 20, 30 and 60. The results were compared to a semi-quantitative scoring system.Quantitative accumulation of collagen fibres was observed from day 3 to day 14, with a slight further increase thereafter. During ongoing fibrogenesis, there was a significant elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and bilirubin. The results from our computer-based morphometric analysis were highly correlated with the results that were obtained in a standardized pathology semi-quantitative scoring system (R 2 = 0.89, n = 38).Using our Delphi-based image analysing software, the morphometric assessment of fibrosis is as precise as semi-quantitative scoring by an experienced pathologist. This program can be a valuable tool in any kind of experimental or clinical setting for standardized quantitative assessment of fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Clustering is crucial for gene expression data analysis. As an unsupervised exploratory procedure its results can help researchers to gain insights and formulate new hypothesis about biological data from microarrays. Given different settings of microarray experiments, clustering proves itself as a versatile exploratory tool. It can help to unveil new cancer subtypes or to identify groups of genes that respond similarly to a specific experimental condition. In order to obtain useful clustering results, however, different parameters of the clustering procedure must be properly tuned. Besides the selection of the clustering method itself, determining which distance is going to be employed between data objects is probably one of the most difficult decisions.We analyze how different distances and clustering methods interact regarding their ability to cluster gene expression, i.e., microarray data. We study 15 distances along with four common clustering methods from the literature on a total of 52 gene expression microarray datasets. Distances are evaluated on a number of different scenarios including clustering of cancer tissues and genes from short time-series expression data, the two main clustering applications in gene expression. Our results support that the selection of an appropriate distance depends on the scenario in hand. Moreover, in each scenario, given the very same clustering method, significant differences in quality may arise from the selection of distinct distance measures. In fact, the selection of an appropriate distance measure can make the difference between meaningful and poor clustering outcomes, even for a suitable clustering method.},

Besides selecting a clustering algorithm, choosing an appropriate proximity measure (similarity or distance) is of great importance to achieve satisfactory clustering results. Nevertheless, up to date, there are no comprehensive guidelines concerning how to choose proximity measures for clustering microarray data. Pearson is the most used proximity measure, whereas characteristics of other ones remain unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the choice of proximity measures for the clustering of microarray data by evaluating the performance of 16 proximity measures in 52 data sets from time course and cancer experiments. Our results support that measures rarely employed in the gene expression literature can provide better results than commonly employed ones, such as Pearson, Spearman, and euclidean distance. Given that different measures stood out for time course and cancer data evaluations, their choice should be specific to each scenario. To evaluate measures on time-course data, we preprocessed and compiled 17 data sets from the microarray literature in a benchmark along with a new methodology, called Intrinsic Biological Separation Ability (IBSA). Both can be employed in future research to assess the effectiveness of new measures for gene time-course data.},

  Abstract                 = {A study has been made of sequential changes in the rat's liver from 1 to 40 days after obstruction of the common bile duct. The qualitative changes have been described and illustrated. The volume proportions of hepatocytes, bile duct epithelium and biliary stroma have been quantified by histological analysis using a point counting technique. The proliferation of hepatocytes and bile duct cells have been measured by labelling with tritiated thymidine. The absolute quantity of hepatocytes in each liver has been estimated and expressed as a percentage of body weight. Over 40 days there is a relative fall in the volume proportion of hepatocytes and an increase in bile duct cells and biliary stroma. These changes in volume proportions are related directly to the period of jaundice. Biliary stroma increases in support of new bile duct tissue and there is no excessive fibrosis. Hepatocytes proliferate at a greater rate than normal after obstruction of the common bile duct and the degree of proliferation reaches a maximum of 24 times that of normal 4 days after obstruction. Similarly, the proliferation of bile duct epithelium is increased in obstructive jaundice but in this instance it reaches a maximum of 50 times that of normal 24 h after ligation of the common bile duct. The absolute quantity of hepatocytes in the liver probably falls during the period of jaundice. However, the fall is less than anticipated from the volume proportion of hepatocytes because of the overall increase in liver size.},

  Abstract                 = {Constant intense light causes apoptosis of rod and cone photoreceptors in adult albino zebrafish. The photoreceptors subsequently regenerate from proliferating inner nuclear layer (INL) progenitor cells that migrate to the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and differentiate into rods and cones. To identify gene expression changes during this photoreceptor regeneration response, a microarray analysis was performed at five time points during the light treatment. The time course included an early time point during photoreceptor death (16 h), later time points during progenitor cell proliferation and migration (31, 51, and 68 h) and a 96 h time point, which likely corresponds to the initial photoreceptor differentiation. Mean expression values for each gene were calculated at each time point relative to the control (0 h light exposure) and statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA identified 4567 genes exhibiting significant changes in gene expression along the time course. The genes within this data set were clustered based on their temporal expression patterns and proposed functions. Quantitative real-time PCR validated the microarray expression profiles for selected genes, including stat3 whose expression increased markedly during the light exposure. Based on immunoblots, both total and activated Stat3 protein expression also increased during the light treatment. Immunolocalization of Stat3 on retinal tissue sections demonstrated increased expression in photoreceptors and Müller glia by 16 h of light exposure. Some of the Stat3-positive Müller cells expressed PCNA at 31 h, suggesting that Stat3 may play a role in signaling a subset of Müller cells to proliferate during the regeneration response.},

The study included 175 alcoholic cirrhotic patients (ACPs), 140 non-alcoholic cirrhotic patients (NACPs), visiting Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI), Lucknow, India, 255 non-alcoholic controls and 140 alcoholic controls. The data showed an increase in risk to alcoholic cirrhosis in ACPs with GSTM1 (null) genotype when compared with non-alcoholic controls (OR: 1.7; 95\% CI: 1.15-2.56) or alcoholic controls (OR: 1.7; 95\% CI: 1.07-2.73). Significant increase in risk was also observed in ACPs with variant genotype of GSTP1 when compared with non-alcoholic controls (OR: 1.65; 95\% CI: 1.12-2.43). A much higher risk to alcoholic liver cirrhosis was observed in patients carrying combination of null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 (OR: 2.8; 95\% CI: 1.3-6.06) or variant genotype of GSTP1 and null genotype of GSTM1 (OR: 2.8; 95\% CI: 1.58-4.90) or GSTT1 (OR: 2.16; 95\% CI: 1.08-4.28). Likewise, greater risk for alcoholic cirrhosis was observed in patients carrying combination of GSTM1, GSTT1 (null) and variant genotype of GSTP1 (OR: 5.8; 95\% CI: 2.17-15.80). Our data further showed that interaction of GSTs with variant genotype of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), which detoxifies free radicals, or cytochrome P450 2E1, which generates free radicals, resulted in several fold increase in risk to alcoholic liver cirrhosis in ACPs when compared with non-alcoholic controls thus demonstrating the role of gene-gene interactions in modulating the risk to alcoholic liver cirrhosis.},

Liver transplantation is the only treatment available for patients with advanced stage of fibrosis. Therefore, alternative methods are required to develop new strategies for anti-fibrotic therapy. Available treatments are designed to substitute for liver transplantation or bridge the patients, they include inhibitors of fibrogenic cytokines such as TGF-β1 and EGF, inhibitors of rennin angiotensin system, and blockers of TLR4 signalling. Development of liver fibrosis is orchestrated by many cell types. However, activated myofibroblasts remain the primary target for anti-fibrotic therapy. Hepatic stellate cells and portal fibroblasts are considered to play a major role in development of liver fibrosis. Here we discuss the origin of activated myofibroblasts and different aspects of their activation, differentiation and potential inactivation during regression of liver fibrosis.},

Throughout the experiment most of the morphological changes observed in the cannulated group were comparable to those in the ligated group. Portal inflammation and marginal bile duct proliferation were noted with the same frequency in both groups. Biliary obstruction for 15 days or more led to cirrhosis. After 28 days obstruction, five out of six cannulated rats and four out of six ligated animals respectively developed cirrhosis. The development of cirrhosis was progressive and associated with ascites. It is concluded that in the rat the morphological sequelae of long term cholestasis induced by either cannulation and obstruction or ligation of bile ducts are similar and are accompanied by cirrhosis. The advantages of this experimental model for the study of human cirrhosis are discussed.},

Here, we show that stromelysin-2 enhances migration of cultured keratinocytes. To gain insight into the in vivo activities of stromelysin-2 in epithelial repair, we generated transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active stromelysin-2 mutant in keratinocytes. These animals had no alterations in skin architecture, and the healing rate of skin wounds was normal. Histologically, however, we found abnormalities in the organization of the wound epithelium. Keratinocytes at the migrating epidermal tip were scattered in most sections of mice with high expression level, and there was a reduced deposition of new matrix. In particular, the staining pattern of laminin-5 at the wound site was altered. This may be due to proteolytic processing of laminin-5 by stromelysin-2, because degradation of laminin-5 by this enzyme was observed in vitro. The inappropriate matrix contact of keratinocytes was accompanied by aberrant localization of beta1-integrins and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase, as well as by increased apoptosis of wound keratinocytes. These results suggest that a tightly regulated expression level of stromelysin-2 is required for limited matrix degradation at the wound site, thereby controlling keratinocyte migration.},

Our objective in this study was to assay molecular indicators of acute hepatic injury associated with the administration of indomethacin, a prototypical NSAID, metabolized by the liver that undergoes enterohepatic circulation with associated gastrointestinal adverse effects.Analysis of gene expression, using high-throughput, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion)-specific microarrays, was performed on RNA extracted from the livers of control or indomethacin treated rats, in parallel with serum enzyme tests and histological analysis of paraffin-embedded liver specimens. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 45) were administered intraperitoneal injections of indomethacin for 3 days at the recommended normal dose (6.7 mg/kg), indomethacin at a high dose (20 mg/kg) or vehicle alone (controls).Upon termination of the study on day 4, serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activity and alkaline phosphatase/alanine aminotransferase ratios were significantly elevated in both high- and normal-dose cohorts compared with vehicle-treated animals. Diffuse microvascular steatosis was present in hepatic serial sections obtained from all animals subjected to the high-dosage regimen. High-resolution microarray analysis (six replicates/gene/animal) identified 256 genes, after outlier removal, in 17 functional classifications that were significantly altered by the high, but not by the normal dosage. These included depression of 10 of 11 cytochrome P450 genes (2B3, 2C70, 1A2-P2, 4F1, 2E1, 3A1, 2F1, 3AP7, 2C11, phenobarb-inducible P6) and 7 of 9 genes involved in the response to reactive oxygen species (e.g. glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, and superoxide dismutase). Of 16 genes associated with toxin removal, nine exhibited significantly decreased transcripts. There was a marked shift away from lipid metabolism (decreased expression of eight genes) towards glucose utilization associated with steatosis. Despite the compromise of detoxification programs and a shift in metabolic substrate utilization, a compensatory remodeling response was activated, including genes for metalloproteases (ADAM10, MMP10, MMP11), integrins (integrin alpha-1 and alpha-E1), and extracellular matrix molecules (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan), as well as transcripts associated with cell proliferation. The expression levels of only five genes were significantly altered among animals receiving the normal indomethacin dosage.These data confirmed that even brief exposure to indomethacin altered serum enzymatic activities and that high levels significantly altered gene expression in the liver and hepatic histology (by interfering with the clearance of toxins and xenobiotic substrates) and the regulation of basal metabolism.},

  Abstract                 = {The CCN family is a group of six secreted proteins that specifically associate with the extracellular matrix. Structurally, CCN proteins are modular, containing up to four distinct functional domains. CCN family members are induced by growth factors and cytokines such as TGFbeta and endothelin 1 and cellular stress such as hypoxia, and are overexpressed in pathological conditions that affect connective tissues, including scarring, fibrosis and cancer. Although CCN family members were discovered over a decade ago, the precise biological role, mechanism of action and physiological function of these proteins has remained elusive until recently, when several key mechanistic insights into the CCN family emerged. The CCNs have been shown to have key roles as matricellular proteins, serving as adaptor molecules connecting the cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM). Although they appear not to have specific high-affinity receptors, they signal through integrins and proteoglycans. Furthermore, in addition to having inherent adhesive abilities that modulate focal adhesions and control cell attachment and migration, they execute their functions by modulating the activity of a variety of different growth factors, such as TGFbeta. CCN proteins not only regulate crucial biological processes including cell differentiation, proliferation, adhesion, migration, apoptosis, ECM production, chondrogenesis and angiogenesis, but also have more sinister roles promoting conditions such as fibrogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Serum bilirubin measurements are commonly obtained for the evaluation of ill patients and to screen for liver disease in routine physical exams. An enormous research effort has identified the multiple mechanisms involved in the production and metabolism of conjugated (CB) and unconjugated bilirubin (UB). While the qualitative effects of these mechanisms are well understood, their expected quantitative influence on serum bilirubin homeostasis has received less attention. In this review, each of the steps involved in bilirubin production, metabolism, hepatic cell uptake, and excretion is quantitatively examined. We then attempt to predict the expected effect of normal and defective function on serum UB and CB levels in health and disease states including hemolysis, extra- and intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatocellular diseases (eg, cirrhosis, hepatitis), and various congenital defects in bilirubin conjugation and secretion (eg, Gilbert's, Dubin-Johnson, Crigler-Najjar, Rotor syndromes). Novel aspects of this review include: 1) quantitative estimates of the free and total UB and CB in the plasma, hepatocyte, and bile; 2) detailed discussion of the important implications of the recently recognized role of the hepatic OATP transporters in the maintenance of CB homeostasis; 3) discussion of the differences between the standard diazo assay versus chromatographic measurement of CB and UB; 4) pharmacokinetic implications of the extremely high-affinity albumin binding of UB; 5) role of the enterohepatic circulation in physiologic jaundice of newborn and fasting hyperbilirubinemia; and 6) insights concerning the clinical interpretation of bilirubin measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Bile acid (BA) biosynthesis is tightly controlled by intrahepatic negative feedback signaling elicited by BA binding to farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and also by enterohepatic communication involving ileal BA reabsorption and FGF15/19 secretion. However, how these pathways are coordinated is poorly understood. We show here that nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 is a critical player that couples and regulates the intrahepatic and enterohepatic signals for repression of BA synthesis. Ablating Shp2 in hepatocytes suppressed signal relay from FGFR4, receptor for FGF15/19, and attenuated BA activation of FXR signaling, resulting in elevation of systemic BA levels and chronic hepatobiliary disorders in mice. Acting immediately downstream of FGFR4, Shp2 associates with FRS2α and promotes the receptor activation and signal relay to several pathways. These results elucidate a molecular mechanism for the control of BA homeostasis by Shp2 through the orchestration of multiple signals in hepatocytes.},

  Abstract                 = {The Golgi phosphoprotein GP73 is elevated in the circulation of individuals with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Its usefulness as a biomarker of HCC is questioned, since it has also been reported to be elevated in the circulation of people with liver cirrhosis. Regulation of GP73 by inflammatory cytokines is therefore of interest. The interleukin-6 (IL-6) family cytokines were tested for effects on GP73 mRNA and/or protein levels in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells. Levels of GP73 mRNA and protein were up-regulated in HepG2 cells following treatment with either proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 or the related cytokine oncostatin M (OSM). Induction required the shared receptor subunit gp130, and correlated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Maximal cytokine-mediated induction was not observed in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting additional regulatory factors play an important role. ELISA measurement of GP73 and IL-6 levels in the sera of patients with pre-malignant liver disease revealed a significant correlation between circulating levels of the two proteins. Similarly, a sensitive ELISA assay was developed to measure circulating OSM. OSM levels were elevated 6-7 fold in sera from patients with either cirrhosis or HCC relative to controls without liver disease. Although there was an association between levels of GP73 and OSM in serum from people with liver cirrhosis, there was not a statistically significant correlation in HCC, suggesting that the role of the cytokines in determining circulating levels may be complex. To our knowledge, this is the first report of OSM elevation being associated with liver disease.},

Systemic and portal serum bile acids were also determined in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. In 5 patients, in whom a portal catheter was inserted through the umbilical vein, the diurnal variation in systemic and portal serum bile acid concentration was studied. In patients with presumably normal liver function the fasting systemic serum bile acid concentration was 4.8+/-0.5 mumol times 1(-1), and the portal concentration was 12.9+/-1.5 mumol times 1(-1). In cholestasis and liver cirrhosis the systemic and portal bile acid concentration was substantially elevated. The bile acid concentration gradient between systemic serum, portal serum, liver tissue, and hepatic bile was 1:3:80:2600 in the patients with normal liver function. In both the cholestatic and cirrhotic condition the systemic and portal serum bile acid concentration was equilibrated. Postprandially both the systemic and portal bile acid concentration increased, but the gradient between these concentrations was unchanged. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that portal and systemic serum bile acid concentrations are determined by the intestinal absorption rate in subjects with normal liver function and by the hepatic and renal clearance capacity in cholestatic and cirrhotic conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {In fibrotic liver, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is constantly expressed in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and acts downstream of TGF-β to modulate extracellular matrix production. Distinct from other cell types in which Smad signaling plays major role in regulating CTGF production, TGF-β stimulated CTGF expression in activated HSCs is only in part dependent on Smad3. Other signaling molecules like MAPKs and PI3Ks may also participate in this process, and the underlying mechanisms have yet to be clarified. In this study, we report involvement of Stat3 activation in modulating CTGF production upon TGF-β challenge in activated HSCs. Stat3 is phosphorylated via JAK1 and acts as a critical ALK5 (activin receptor-like kinase 5) downstream signaling molecule to mediate CTGF expression. This process requires de novo gene transcription and is additionally modulated by MEK1/2, JNK, and PI3K pathways. Cell-specific knockdown of Smad3 partially decreases CTGF production, whereas it has no significant influence on Stat3 activation. The total CTGF production induced by TGF-β in activated HSCs is therefore, to a large extent, dependent on the balance and integration of the canonical Smad3 and Stat3 signaling pathways.},

The nuclear receptor LXRalpha binds oxysterols and mediates feed-forward induction. Here, we show that repression is coordinately regulated by a triumvirate of nuclear receptors, including the bile acid receptor, FXR; the promoter-specific activator, LRH-1; and the promoter-specific repressor, SHP. Feedback repression of CYP7A1 is accomplished by the binding of bile acids to FXR, which leads to transcription of SHP. Elevated SHP protein then inactivates LRH-1 by forming a heterodimeric complex that leads to promoter-specific repression of both CYP7A1 and SHP. These results reveal an elaborate autoregulatory cascade mediated by nuclear receptors for the maintenance of hepatic cholesterol catabolism.},

  Abstract                 = {Bile salts have a crucial role in hepatobiliary and intestinal homeostasis and digestion. Primary bile salts are synthesized by the liver from cholesterol, and may be modified by the intestinal flora to form secondary and tertiary bile salts. Bile salts are efficiently reabsorbed from the intestinal lumen to undergo enterohepatic circulation. In addition to their function as a surfactant involved in the absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins bile salts are potent signaling molecules in both the liver and intestine. Under physiological conditions the bile salt pool is tightly regulated, but the adaptive capacity may fall short under cholestatic conditions. Elevated serum and tissue levels of potentially toxic hydrophobic bile salts during cholestasis may cause mitochondrial damage, apoptosis or necrosis in susceptible cell types. Therapeutic nontoxic bile salts may restore impaired hepatobiliary secretion in cholestatic disorders. The hydrophilic bile salt ursodeoxycholate is today regarded as the effective standard treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and is implicated for use in various other cholestatic conditions. Novel therapeutic bile salts that are currently under evaluation may also prove valuable in the treatment of these diseases.},

The aim of this study was to study the relationship of growth factor expression to inflammation and fibrosis in a variety of human liver diseases.We studied by in situ hybridization the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A and PDGF-B, and procollagen type I (pro-I) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in liver diseases of various etiologies.Pro-I mRNA was expressed by mesenchymal cells at sites of inflammation and scarring, where TGF-beta 1 immunoreactivity was often found, and by perisinusoidal cells. TGF-beta 1 and PDGF-A mRNAs were expressed mainly by mononuclear cells and proliferating ductular cells. TGF-beta 1 mRNA was also expressed by perisinusoidal cells. PDGF-A gene expression was more common than that of PDGF-B. Pro-I and TGF-beta 1 expression correlated with both ductular proliferation and tissue inflammation, whereas PDGF-A and PDGF-B only correlated with ductular proliferation.Our data suggest that TGF-beta 1 and PDGF are involved in human liver inflammation and fibrosis. The expression of growth factor mRNAs in proliferating ductular cells may indicate a role for these cells in liver fibrogenesis and may help explain the pathophysiology of conditions such as biliary atresia progressing to fibrosis despite the absence of marked inflammation.},

Different cellular sources, including tissue-resident and bone marrow-derived fibroblasts, pericytes and epithelial cells, have been suggested to give rise to myofibroblasts, but their relative contributions remain controversial, with profound differences between organs and different diseases. Here we employ a novel Cre-transgenic mouse that marks 99\% of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a liver-specific pericyte population, to demonstrate that HSCs give rise to 82-96\% of myofibroblasts in models of toxic, cholestatic and fatty liver disease. Moreover, we exclude that HSCs function as facultative epithelial progenitor cells in the injured liver. On the basis these findings, HSCs should be considered the primary cellular target for antifibrotic therapies across all types of liver disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette membrane transporter family, which is expressed apically in liver, kidney, and intestine epithelium. Recent reports suggest that in addition to xenobiotics, porphyrins, and food toxins, Bcrp can also transport bile acids and, therefore, may participate in the adaptive response to cholestasis. Bile duct ligation (BDL), an experimental model of obstructive cholestasis, was performed in male wild-type (WT) and Bcrp knockout (KO) mice. An initial time course of 3, 7, and 14 days of BDL in WT mice revealed that Bcrp expression was significantly reduced in liver but increased in ileum by 7 days. Subsequent experiments using 7-day BDL in WT and Bcrp KO mice demonstrated that there was no difference in liver necrosis, serum glutamic pyruvate aminotransferase, bilirubin, or bile acid levels in serum, hepatic tissue, bile, urine, or feces between the two groups. Protein expression levels for liver organic solute transporter (Ost) α and multidrug resistance protein 1 and kidney multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp) 2, Mrp3, and Mrp4 were significantly greater in the sham Bcrp KO versus sham WT mice. The expression of Mrp2 and Mrp4 in KO kidneys was further increased after BDL. In contrast, the adaptive response of transporters to BDL in the liver was similar in KO and WT BDL mice, including Ostα and Ostβ expression, which increased in liver and kidney but decreased in the ileum. These findings suggest that Bcrp does not have a significant role in the adaptive response to cholestasis in the liver but may be more important for solute export in the kidney and intestine.},

The aim of the current study was to clarify the mechanism of excessive inflammation and susceptibility to infection in OJ.C57/BL6 mice were subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham surgery. Expression tumor necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, inducible protein-10, and interleukin (IL)-10, activation of nuclear factor kappa B, fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis, serum alanine aminotransferase levels, and histology were examined. Survival after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration or cecal ligation and puncture 3 or 14 d after surgery was determined. IL-1beta and interferon-gamma expression was examined after LPS administration.OJ induced nuclear factor kappa B activation and increased expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-2, which caused significant increases in neutrophil recruitment. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels increased consistent with histological observations in OJ. Mononuclear cells were recruited in the liver after BDL associated with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 up-regulation. The recruitment of NK and T cells was varied, consistent with IP-10 expression during the time course of OJ. IL-10 expression was significantly up-regulated 14 d after BDL. After LPS administration, the mice at 3 d after BDL and at 3 and 14 d after sham surgery were all still alive, but all mice at 14 d after BDL died. After LPS administration, IL-1beta significantly increased in the mice at 14 d after BDL.Immune response such as expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and recruitment of immune cells may thus differ over the time course of OJ. Prolonged OJ may cause excessive inflammation, thus result in susceptibility to infection.},

Primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis are the most commonly recognized cholestatic liver disease in the adult population, while biliary atresia and Alagille syndrome are commonly recognized in the pediatric population. In infants, the causes are usually congenital or inherited. Even though jaundice is a hallmark of cholestasis, it is not always seen in adult patients with chronic liver disease. Patients can have "silent" progressive cholestatic liver disease for years prior to development of symptoms such as jaundice and pruritus. In this review, we will discuss some of the atypical causes of cholestatic liver disease such as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, Alagille Syndrome, biliary atresia, total parenteral nutrition induced cholestasis and cholestasis secondary to drug induced liver injury.},

  Abstract                 = {Interleukin (IL)28B polymorphisms are associated with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and response to therapy. Whether IL28B genotype affects fibrosis progression or clinical outcome is unclear. Our aim was to study the relationship between IL28B genotype and both histological and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Hepatic fibrosis was scored using the Ishak (0-6) scale; progression was defined as a 2-point increase in Ishak score between biopsies. Multiple logistic and Cox regressions were used to identify variables associated with fibrosis progression. In all, 1,483 patients were included in a baseline cross-sectional analysis, from which 276 were eligible for a paired biopsy analysis (median time between biopsies 4 years), and 400 for a clinical outcome analysis. At baseline biopsy, patients with IL28B CC genotype had significantly higher portal inflammation (2.4 versus 2.2) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (133 versus 105 U/L; P < 0.05 for all). In the paired biopsy analysis, there was no difference in the frequency of fibrosis progression between patients with IL28B CC and non-CC genotypes (17\% versus 23\%). In logistic regression, only higher baseline alkaline phosphatase, lower platelets, and greater hepatic steatosis were associated with fibrosis progression. Patients with IL28B CC were twice as likely to develop adverse clinical outcomes compared to non-CC (32\% versus 16\%; P = 0.007).IL28B CC genotype was associated with greater hepatic necroinflammation, higher ALT, and worse clinical outcomes in CHC patients. This suggests that IL28B CC is associated with a state of enhanced immunity that, on the one hand, can promote viral clearance, but alternately can increase necroinflammation and hepatic decompensation without enhancing fibrosis progression.},

  Abstract                 = {Patients with decompensated cirrhosis are susceptible to infection. Innate immune dysfunction and development of organ failure are considered to underlie this. A rodent model of liver disease sharing these phenotypic features would assist in vivo study of underlying mechanisms and testing of therapeutics. We evaluated three models to identify which demonstrated the greatest clinical and immunological phenotypic similarity to patients with acutely decompensated (AD) cirrhosis.We selected Bile Duct Ligation (BDL) rats at 4 weeks, BDL mice at 14 days and Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ) mice at 10 weeks (with studies performed 7 days after final CCl4 infection). We examined organ dysfunction, inflammatory response to carrageenan-in-paw, plasma eicosanoid concentrations, macrophage cytokine production and responses to peritoneal infection.Bile duct ligation caused sarcopenia, liver, cardiovascular and renal dysfunction whereas CCl4 mice demonstrated no clinical abnormalities. BDL rodents exhibited depressed response to carrageenan-in-paw unlike CCl4 mice. BDL rats have slightly elevated plasma eicosanoid levels and plasma showed partial PGE2 -mediated immune suppression whereas CCl4 mice did not. Plasma NOx was elevated in patients with acute or chronic liver failure (AoCLF) compared to healthy volunteers and BDL rodents but not CCl4 mice. Elevated nitric oxide (NO) via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mediates defective leucocyte trafficking in BDL rodent models.We conclude that BDL mice and rats are not simply models of cholestatic liver injury but may be used to study mechanisms underlying poor outcome from infection in AD and have identified elevated NO as a potential mediator of depressed leucocyte trafficking.},

  Abstract                 = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which is a mediator of hepatotoxicity, has been implicated in liver fibrosis. However, the roles of TNF-α on hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and liver fibrosis are complicated and remain controversial. To explore this issue, the role of TNF-α in cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis was examined by comparing between TNF-α(-/-) mice and TNF-α(+/+) mice after bile duct ligation (BDL). Serum TNF-α levels in mice were increased by common BDL combined with cystic duct ligation (CBDL+CDL). TNF-α deficiency reduced liver fibrosis without affecting liver injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, and liver regeneration after CBDL+CDL. Increased expression levels of collagen α1(I) mRNA, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β mRNA, and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) protein by CBDL+CDL in the livers of TNF-α(-/-) mice were comparable to those in TNF-α(+/+) mice. Exogenous administration of TNF-α decreased collagen α1(I) mRNA expression in isolated rat HSCs. These results suggest that the reduced fibrosis in TNF-α(-/-) mice is regulated in post-transcriptional level. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. TIMP-1 expression in HSCs in the liver was increased by CBDL+CDL, and the induction was lower in TNF-α(-/-) mice than in TNF-α(+/+) mice. Fibrosis in the lobe of TIMP-1(-/-) mice with partial BDL was also reduced. These findings indicate that TNF-α produced by cholestasis can promote liver fibrosis via TIMP-1 production from HSCs. Thus, targeting TNF-α and TIMP-1 may become a new therapeutic strategy for treating liver fibrosis in cholestatic liver injury.},

Knowledge-based, or systems biology, approaches that involve the analysis of integrated data, predominantly molecular pathways and networks may infer quantitative changes in the levels of biomolecules not included by the given assay from the levels of the analytes profiled. In this study we attempted to use a knowledge-based approach to predict biomarkers reflecting the changes in underlying protein phosphorylation events using Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) as a model. Two soluble biomarkers, CCL-2 and FasL, were inferred in silico as relevant to NAFLD pathogenesis. Predictive performance of these biomarkers was studied using serum samples collected from patients with histologically proven NAFLD. Serum levels of both molecules, in combination with clinical and demographic data, were predictive of hepatic fibrosis in a cohort of NAFLD patients. Our study suggests that (1) NASH-specific disruption of the kinase-driven signaling cascades in visceral adipose tissue lead to detectable changes in the levels of soluble molecules released into the bloodstream, and (2) biomarkers discovered in silico could contribute to predictive models for non-malignant chronic diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) stimulates in vitro fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. The aim of this study was to assess the role of CTGF in liver fibrogenesis. CTGF expression was investigated both at the protein and mRNA level in biopsies of chronic liver diseases, in experimental models of liver fibrosis, and in hepatic stellate cells in culture. CTGF immunostaining was observed in most human liver biopsies with significant fibrosis. An increase of CTGF immunostaining was associated with a higher score of fibrosis both in the group of chronic hepatitis C (chi(2) = 9.3; P <.01) and in the non-hepatitis C group (chi(2) = 7.2; P <.02). In situ hybridization showed CTGF mRNA expression in spindle cells in both the fibrous septa and sinusoidal lining. In experimental models of liver fibrosis, CTGF accumulated in parallel with the development of septal fibrosis and cirrhosis. Quantification of CTGF mRNA by a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay showed a significant increase of CTGF mRNA in both CCl(4)-induced and bile duct-ligated rat models of liver fibrosis. Expression of CTGF protein and mRNA was definitively assigned to hepatic stellate cells, because CTGF was detected by Western blot both in lysate and supernatant of a hepatic stellate cell line derived from rats. These cells also displayed CTGF protein and mRNA as shown by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In conclusion, this study shows that CTGF is strongly expressed during liver fibrogenesis, and hepatic stellate cells seem to be the major cellular sources of CTGF in the liver.},

  Abstract                 = {Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is a key step in process of liver fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is the most powerful mediator of HSC activation and plays a central role in liver fibrosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is an important regulator of adipocyte differentiation and has been proposed as a crucial factor for inhibition of HSC activation. The effect of TGF-β1 on PPARγ in HSCs is largely unknown. This study is aimed to examine whether TGF-β1 can influence PPARγ expression, focusing on the role of β-catenin pathway, a key pathway linked to adipogenesis, in TGF-β1 regulation of PPARγ in cultured HSCs. Our results demonstrated that TGF-β1 evidently inhibited PPARγ expression and activity in cultured HSCs, which were mediated through β-catenin pathway. TGF-β1 promoted β-catenin expression and also increased the stability of β-catenin protein through ERK1/2/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) axis in cultured HSCs. Moreover, TGF-β1 inhibition of PPARγ expression by β-catenin pathway caused the increase in alpha1(1) collagen and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase expression. These results indicated for the first time that TGF-β1 could down-regulate PPARγ expression through β-catenin pathway and subsequently contributed to the increase in alpha1(1) collagen level in cultured HSCs.},

  Abstract                 = {Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is a highly profibrogenic molecule which is overexpressed in many fibrotic lesions, including those of the liver. CTGF/CCN2 is transcriptionally activated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and appears to mediate some of the extracellular matrix (ECM)-inducing properties that have been previously attributed to TGF-beta. CTGF/CCN2 and TGF-beta stimulate connective tissue cell proliferation and ECM synthesis in vitro and exhibit shared fibrogenic and angiogenic properties in vivo. In fibrotic liver, CTGF/CCN2 mRNA and protein are produced by fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), endothelial cells, and bile duct epithelial cells. CTGF/CCN2 is also produced at high levels in hepatocytes during cytochrome P-4502E1-mediated ethanol oxidation. CTGF/CCN2 expression in cultured HSCs is enhanced following their activation or stimulation by TGF-beta while exogenous CTGF/CCN2 is able to promote HSC adhesion, proliferation, locomotion, and collagen production. Collectively, these data suggest that during initiating or downstream fibrogenic events in the liver, production of CTGF/CCN2 is regulated primarily by TGF-beta in one or more cell types and that CTGF/CCN2 plays important roles in HSC activation and progression of fibrosis. This article reviews the data that support the importance of CTGF/CCN2 in hepatic fibrosis and highlights the concept that CTGF/CCN2 may represent a new therapeutic target in this disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Because interleukin-10 (IL-10) seems a promising new antifibrotic drug, we investigated the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profile of this potent therapeutic cytokine in rats with extensive liver fibrosis (BDL-3). IL-10 receptor expression was also determined in relation to these aspects.To study the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution of IL-10, rhIL-10 was labeled with 125-iodine. Plasma samples of 125IrhIL-10 were obtained over a 30-min time period after administration of radiolabeled-cytokine to BDL-3 and normal rats. The tissue distribution was assessed 10 and 30 min after i.v. administration of 125IrhlL-10. IL-10 receptor expression was determined by immurohistochemical staining and RT-PCR technique.. The 125IrhIL-10 plasma curves followed two-compartment kinetics with a lower AUC in BDL-3 rats as compared to control. Plasma clearance and distribution volume at steady state were larger in BDL-3 rats. Tissue distribution analysis in normal rats showed that 125IrhIL-10 highly accumulated in kidneys. In BDL-3 rats, the liver content of 125IrhIL-10 increased by a factor of 2, whereas kidney accumulation did not significantly change. Immunohistochemical staining and RT-PCR analysis showed that IL-10 receptor was clearly upregulated in BDL-3 rat livers.. In normal rats, 125IrhIL-10 rapidly disappears from the circulation, and the kidney is predominantly responsible for this. In BDL-3 rats, the liver largely contributes to this rapid plasma disappearance, probably due to an increase in IL-10 receptor expression. The extensive renal clearance of IL-10 in vivo may limit a clinical application of this cytokine for the treatment of chronic liver diseases. To optimize the therapeutic effects of IL-10 in hepatic diseases, alternative approaches that either decrease renal disposition or that further enhance hepatic delivery should be considered.},

  Abstract                 = {The portal area is the 'main entrance' and one of the two main exits of the liver lobule. Through the main entrance portal and arterial blood reach the liver sinusoids. Through the exit the bile flows towards the duodenum. The three main structures, portal vein and artery with their own wall (and vascular smooth muscle cells) and bile duct with its basal membrane, are surrounded by loose myofibroblasts and by the first layer of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells. Chronic diseases of the liver can lead to development of liver cirrhosis, characterized by formation of fibrotic septa which can be portal-portal in the case of the chronic biliary damage or portal-central in the case of the chronic viral hepatitis. Central-central septa can also be observed under other pathological conditions. When damaging noxae are introduced to the liver, inflammatory cells are first recruited to the portal field, the first layer of hepatocytes may be destroyed (enlargement of the portal field) and portal (myo)fibroblasts become activated. A similar reaction may take place when the target of inflammation is the bile duct with consecutive reduction of the bile flow, activation of the portal (myo)fibroblasts, proliferation of bile ducts and destruction of the hepatocytes around the portal field. Increased matrix deposition may be the consequence. During the past years several publications dealt with the pathomechanisms of portal fibrogenesis as well as with its resolution. One of the most intriguing observations was that it is not hepatic stellate cells of the hepatic sinusoid, but portal (myo)fibroblasts which rapidly acquire the phenotype of 'activated' (myo)fibroblasts in the early stages of cholestatic fibrosis. These may also become the main mesenchymal cells of the porto-portal or porto-central fibrotic septa. This article reviews the similarities as well as differences between the mesenchymal cells of the portal tract and of the fibrotic septa vs 'activated' stellate cells of the hepatic sinusoids, and discusses the debate over their relative contributions to liver fibrogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {The epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation is an important mechanism to control the expression of stem cell factors as demonstrated in tumor cells. It was recently shown that hepatic stellate cells (HSC) express stem/progenitor cell factors and have a differentiation potential. The aim of this work was to investigate if the expression of stem cell markers is regulated by DNA methylation during activation of rat HSC. It was found that CD133, Notch1, and Notch3 are regulated via DNA methylation in HSC, whereas Nestin shows no DNA methylation in HSC and other undifferentiated cells such as embryonic stem cells and umbilical cord blood stem cells from rats. In contrast to this, DNA methylation controls Nestin expression in differentiated cells like hepatocytes and the hepatoma cell line H4IIE. Demethylation by 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine was sufficient to induce Nestin in H4IIE cells. In quiescent stellate cells and embryonic stem cells, the Nestin expression was suppressed by histone H3 methylation at lysine 9, which is another epigenetic mechanism. Apart from the known induction of Nestin in cultured HSC, this intermediate filament protein was also induced after partial hepatectomy, indicating activation of HSC during liver regeneration. Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time that the expression of stem cell-associated factors such as CD133, Notch1, and Notch3 is controlled by DNA methylation in HSC. The regulation of Nestin by DNA methylation seems to be restricted to differentiated cells, whereas undifferentiated cells use different epigenetic mechanisms such as histone H3 methylation to control Nestin expression.},

Study of early tissue changes in the time-course of disease recurrence provides a unique insight into the initial stages of the disease process, which, in nontransplant patients, occurs long before clinical presentation. We describe a patient who developed classical clinical, biochemical, immunological, and histological features of PBC within 9 months after transplantation. Use of tissue from this patient before and during the development of PBC allowed us to identify biliary epithelial cell (BEC) epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as a key pathogenetic process. BEC expression of S100A4 (an early fibroblast lineage marker established as a robust marker of EMT), vimentin, and pSmad 2/3 [a marker of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) pathway signaling] were identified immunohistochemically in most BECs in liver tissue from this patient at the point of diagnosis of recurrent disease. BEC expression of S100A4 and pSmad 2/3 was seen as early as 24 days after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), although no other features of recurrent PBC were present at this time.S100A4, vimentin, and pSmad 2/3 expression in early recurrent PBC after OLT suggests that BEC EMT is occurring (potentially explaining BEC loss) and that this process is driven by TGF-beta. S100A4 expression by BEC appears to occur before the development of any other features of recurrent PBC, suggesting that EMT may be an initiating event.},

  Abstract                 = {The response to injury is one of wound healing and fibrogenesis, which ultimately leads to fibrosis. The fibrogenic response to injury is a generalized one across virtually all organ systems. In the liver, the injury response, typically occurring over a prolonged period of time, leads to cirrhosis (although it should be pointed out that not all patients with liver injury develop cirrhosis). The fact that many different diseases result in cirrhosis suggests a common pathogenesis. The study of hepatic fibrogenesis over the past 2 decades has been remarkably active, leading to a considerable understanding of this process. It clearly has been shown that the hepatic stellate cell is a central component in the fibrogenic process. It also has been recognized that other effector cells are important in the fibrogenic process, including resident fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived cells, fibrocytes, and even perhaps cells derived from epithelial cells (ie, through epithelial to mesenchymal transition). A key aspect of the biology of fibrogenesis is that the fibrogenic process is dynamic; thus, even advanced fibrosis (or cirrhosis) is reversible. Together, an understanding of the cellular basis for liver fibrogenesis, along with multiple aspects of the basic pathogenesis of fibrosis, have highlighted many exciting potential therapeutic opportunities. Thus, although the most effective antifibrotic therapy is simply treatment of the underlying disease, in situations in which this is not possible, specific antifibrotic therapy is likely not only to become feasible, but will soon become a reality. This review highlights the mechanisms underlying fibrogenesis that may be translated into future antifibrotic therapies and to review the current state of clinical development.},

  Abstract                 = {The synthesis and excretion of bile acids comprise the major pathway of cholesterol catabolism in mammals. Synthesis provides a direct means of converting cholesterol, which is both hydrophobic and insoluble, into a water-soluble and readily excreted molecule, the bile acid. The biosynthetic steps that accomplish this transformation also confer detergent properties to the bile acid, which are exploited by the body to facilitate the secretion of cholesterol from the liver. This role in the elimination of cholesterol is counterbalanced by the ability of bile acids to solubilize dietary cholesterol and essential nutrients and to promote their delivery to the liver. The synthesis of a full complement of bile acids requires 17 enzymes. The expression of selected enzymes in the pathway is tightly regulated by nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors, which ensure a constant supply of bile acids in an ever changing metabolic environment. Inherited mutations that impair bile acid synthesis cause a spectrum of human disease; this ranges from liver failure in early childhood to progressive neuropathy in adults.},

  Abstract                 = {Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe condition developed in patients with underlying alcoholic liver disease. Ductular reaction has been associated with chronic alcohol consumption but there is no information regarding the extent of liver progenitor cell (LPC) proliferation in AH. The aim of this study was to investigate LPC markers in AH and its correlation with disease severity. Fifty-nine patients with clinical and histological diagnosis of AH were included in the study. LPC markers were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Standard logistic regression analysis and classification and regression trees (CART) analysis were used for statistical analysis. A microarray analysis showed an up-regulation of LPC markers in patients with AH. Real-time PCR demonstrated that epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), Prominin-1, and Keratin7 were significantly increased in patients with AH compared with normal livers (P ≤ 0.01), chronic hepatitis C (P ≤ 0.01), and HCV-induced cirrhosis (P ≤ 0.01). Immunohistochemistry scores generated for Keratin7 and EpCAM demonstrated a good correlation with gene expression. Keratin7 gene expression correlated with liver failure as assessed by model for endstage liver disease score (r = 0.41, P = 0.006) and Maddrey's discriminant function (r = 0.43, P = 0.004). Moreover, Keratin7 (OR1.14, P = 0.004) and Prominin-1 (OR1.14, P = 0.002), but not EpCAM (OR1.16, P = 0.06), were identified as independent predictors of 90-day mortality. CART analysis generated an algorithm based on the combination of Keratin7 and EpCAM gene expression that stratified three groups of patients with high, intermediate, and low short-term mortality (89\%, 33\%, and 6\%, respectively; area under the receiver operating curve 0.73, 95\% confidence interval 0.60-0.87). Keratin7 expression provided additional discrimination potential to the age, bilirubin, international normalization ratio, creatinine (ABIC) score.LPC markers correlate positively with severity of liver disease and short-term mortality in AH patients. This study suggests that LPC proliferation may be an important feature of AH pathophysiology.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholestasis produced by bile duct ligation has been associated with decreased concentrations of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 and decreased hepatic microsomal oxidative drug metabolism. Bile duct ligation producing cholestasis results in a marked increase in hepatic microsomal heme oxygenase activity, with corresponding decreases in hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 concentration, reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-cytochrome c reductase activity, and hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity. As sham-operated rats also demonstrate a less prolonged decrease in cytochrome P450 concentration and reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-cytochrome c reductase activity, the metabolic effects of surgery and anesthesia must also be involved in these alterations in microsomal oxidative drug metabolism. The relative rate of hepatic cytochrome P450 synthesis and of degradation are both decreased after bile duct ligation. These data suggest that decreased hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 concentrations in cholestasis are partly the result of decreased cytochrome P450 synthesis. Increased levels of heme oxygenase activity are not related to increased cytochrome P450 turnover, but may instead reflect enlargement and increased catabolism of a free heme pool resulting from decreased hemoprotein (cytochrome P450) synthesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Progression of liver fibrosis is characterized by synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP) cleave collagen fibers at a specific site and thereby generate soluble fragments of ECM (neo-epitopes). The levels of these neo-epitopes might reflect the stage of liver fibrosis and may allow monitoring of anti-fibrotic therapies. Here we analyzed these neo-epitopes as read-out for a liver directed therapy with statins.Bile duct ligation (BDL) was performed on wild type rats, which received atorvastatin (15 mg/kg(*)d) for 1 week starting at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks after BDL (T1-T5), while controls remained untreated. Hepatic fibrosis was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and hepatic hydroxyproline content. TGFβ levels were measured by RT-PCR. Proteolytic activity of MMP-2 was examined by zymography. Levels of degradation MMP driven type I, III, IV and VI collagen degradation (C1M, C3M, C4M, and C6M) and type III and IV collagen formation (PRO-C3 and P4NP7S) markers were assessed by specific ELISAs in serum probes.Serum markers of ECM neo-epitopes reflected significantly the deposition of ECM in the liver and were able to distinguish between early (T1-T3) and severe fibrosis (T4-T5). Statin treatment resulted in reduction of neo-epitope markers, especially when therapy was started in the stage of severe fibrosis (T4-T5). Furthermore, these markers correlated with hepatic expression of profibrotic cytokines TGFβ1 and TGFβ2. Formation markers of type III and IV collagen (PRO-C3 and P4NP7S) and degradation markers C4M and C6M correlated significantly with hepatic MMP-2 activity in rats with severe fibrosis.Determination of ECM remodeling turnover markers in serum allowed a distinction between mild and severe fibrosis. With respect to statin therapy, the markers may serve as read-out for efficacy of anti-fibrotic treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {Cellular processes cause changes over time. Observing and measuring those changes over time allows insights into the how and why of regulation. The experimental platform for doing the appropriate large-scale experiments to obtain time-courses of expression levels is provided by microarray technology. However, the proper way of analyzing the resulting time course data is still very much an issue under investigation. The inherent time dependencies in the data suggest that clustering techniques which reflect those dependencies yield improved performance.We propose to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to account for the horizontal dependencies along the time axis in time course data and to cope with the prevalent errors and missing values. The HMMs are used within a model-based clustering framework. We are given a number of clusters, each represented by one Hidden Markov Model from a finite collection encompassing typical qualitative behavior. Then, our method finds in an iterative procedure cluster models and an assignment of data points to these models that maximizes the joint likelihood of clustering and models. Partially supervised learning--adding groups of labeled data to the initial collection of clusters--is supported. A graphical user interface allows querying an expression profile dataset for time course similar to a prototype graphically defined as a sequence of levels and durations. We also propose a heuristic approach to automate determination of the number of clusters. We evaluate the method on published yeast cell cycle and fibroblasts serum response datasets, and compare them, with favorable results, to the autoregressive curves method.},

With protracted damage, fibrosis can progress toward excessive scarring and organ failure, as in liver cirrhosis. To date, antifibrotic treatment of fibrosis represents an unconquered area for drug development, with enormous potential but also high risks. Preclinical research has yielded numerous targets for antifibrotic agents, some of which have entered early-phase clinical studies, but progress has been hampered due to the relative lack of sensitive and specific biomarkers to measure fibrosis progression or reversal. Here we focus on antifibrotic approaches for liver that address specific cell types and functional units that orchestrate fibrotic wound healing responses and have a sound preclinical database or antifibrotic activity in early clinical trials. We also touch upon relevant clinical study endpoints, optimal study design, and developments in fibrosis imaging and biomarkers.},

CTGF is up-regulated in disorders such as atherosclerosis, scleroderma, and fibrosis of kidneys and lungs. We investigated the temporospatial expression patterns of CTGF and TGF-beta1 mRNA in rat livers with acute fibrogenesis (after a single dose of CCl(4)) and with advanced fibrosis (6 weeks after complete bile duct occlusion). Multiprobe ribonuclease protection assay revealed increasing TGF-beta1 and CTGF mRNA levels 6 hours after injection of CCl(4), with peak levels after 72 hours. In biliary fibrosis TGF-beta1 and CTGF mRNA levels increased fourfold and sevenfold, respectively (P: < 0.001). In situ hybridization combined with cell-specific markers revealed CTGF transcripts in desmin-positive cells after a single dose of carbon tetrachloride, whereas no transcripts were found in normal livers. In biliary fibrosis, however, proliferating bile duct epithelial cells were the predominant source of CTGF mRNA. We conclude that in rat liver fibrogenesis CTGF is up-regulated in close association with TGF-beta1 and that, contrary to a previous report, not solely hepatic stellate cells but activated bile duct epithelial cells are the main source of this profibrogenic factor.},

  Abstract                 = {Hepatic fibrosis develops as a response to chronic liver injury and almost exclusively occurs in a proinflammatory environment. However, the role of inflammatory mediators in fibrogenic responses of the liver is only poorly understood. We therefore investigated the role of CC chemokines and their receptors in hepatic fibrogenesis. The CC chemokines MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES and their receptors CCR1 and CCR5 were strongly upregulated in 2 experimental mouse models of fibrogenesis. Neutralization of CC chemokines by the broad-spectrum CC chemokine inhibitor 35k efficiently reduced hepatic fibrosis, and CCR1- and CCR5-deficient mice displayed substantially reduced hepatic fibrosis and macrophage infiltration. Analysis of fibrogenesis in CCR1- and CCR5-chimeric mice revealed that CCR1 mediates its profibrogenic effects in BM-derived cells, whereas CCR5 mediates its profibrogenic effects in resident liver cells. CCR5 promoted hepatic stellate cell (HSC) migration through a redox-sensitive, PI3K-dependent pathway. Both CCR5-deficient HSCs and CCR1- and CCR5-deficient Kupffer cells displayed strong suppression of CC chemokine-induced migration. Finally, we detected marked upregulation of RANTES, CCR1, and CCR5 in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, confirming activation of the CC chemokine system in human fibrogenesis. Our data therefore support a role for the CC chemokine system in hepatic fibrogenesis and suggest distinct roles for CCR1 and CCR5 in Kupffer cells and HSCs.},

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase that can decrease the synthesis of nitric oxide. BDL rats have higher plasma and hepatic ADMA levels, which may be due to increased hepatic protein arginine methyltransferase-1 and decreased dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase expression. BDL rats also exhibit renal and brain damage characterized by increased tissue ADMA concentrations. The increased plasma ADMA levels and multiple organ damages seen here are also observed following multiple organ failures associated with critical illness. This review discusses the dysregulation of ADMA in major organs in BDL rats and the role of increased ADMA in multiple organ damages.},

Liver injury associated with BDL for 15 days included significant reactive oxygen/nitrogen species generation, liver inflammation, cell death and fibrosis. Administration of Epigallocatechin 3-Gallate (EGCG) in animals reduced liver fibrosis involving parenchymal cells in BDL model. EGCG attenuated BDL-induced gene expression of pro-fibrotic markers (Collagen, Fibronectin, alpha 2 smooth muscle actin or SMA and connective tissue growth factor or CTGF), mitochondrial oxidative stress, cell death marker (DNA fragmentation and PARP activity), NFκB activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, MIP1α, IL1β, and MIP2). EGCG also improved BDL induced damages of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes and antioxidant defense enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and manganese superoxide dismutase. EGCG also attenuated hydrogen peroxide induced cell death in hepatocytes in vitro and alleviate stellate cells mediated fibrosis through TIMP1, SMA, Collagen 1 and Fibronectin in vitro. In conclusion, the reactive oxygen/nitrogen species generated from mitochondria plays critical pathogenetic role in the progression of liver inflammation and fibrosis and this study indicate that EGCG might be beneficial for reducing liver inflammation and fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Circulating microRNA-122 (miR-122) has been increasingly reported to be a potential biomarker for drug-, viral-, alcohol- and chemical-induced liver injury. The present study was initiated to determine the potential of circulating miR-122 as a biomarker for cholestatic liver injury.Both bile-duct ligation (BDL) mice and patients with biliary calculi were employed as cholestatic liver injury models, and serum miR-122 level was determined by stem-loop real-time reverse-transcription PCR (SLqRT-PCR). All quantitative PCR values were normalized to those for U6 RNA and calculated with the 2(-△Ct) method.Serum miR-122 increased significantly after BDL-induced cholestatic injury and showed a similar time course to ALT concentrations. Compared with the sham controls, BDL mice had increased serum levels of miR-122 by 24.36±12.86, 423.63±322.89, 4.43±2.02 and 12.23±8.92 folds after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days, respectively. Moreover, serum miR-122 level was substantially higher in patients with biliary calculi than that in the healthy control group. In addition, patients with severe liver injury showed significantly higher levels of serum miR-122 when compared with healthy controls or patients with mild or moderate liver injury. Furthermore, serum miR-122 was found to show significant diagnostic value for biliary calculi by yielding an AUC (the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.931 with 77.4\% sensitivity and 96.4\% specificity in discriminating biliary calculi from healthy controls.Collectively, these data suggest that serum miR-122 has strong potential as a novel, specific and noninvasive biomarker for diagnosis of cholestasis-induced liver injury.},

  Abstract                 = {The molecular mechanisms behind human liver disease progression to cirrhosis remain elusive. Nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP/Nr0b2) is a hepatic tumor suppressor and a critical regulator of liver function. SHP expression is diminished in human cirrhotic livers, suggesting a regulatory role in human liver diseases. The goal of this study was to identify novel SHP-regulated genes that are involved in the development and progression of chronic liver disease. To achieve this, we conducted the first comprehensive RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of Shp(-/-) mice, compared the results with human hepatitis C cirrhosis RNA-seq and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) microarray datasets, and verified novel results in human liver biospecimens. This approach revealed new gene signatures associated with chronic liver disease and regulated by SHP. Several genes were selected for validation of physiological relevance based on their marked upregulation, novelty with regard to liver function, and involvement in gene pathways related to liver disease. These genes include peptidoglycan recognition protein 2, dual specific phosphatase-4, tetraspanin 4, thrombospondin 1, and SPARC-related modular calcium binding protein-2, which were validated by qPCR analysis of 126 human liver specimens, including steatosis, fibrosis, and NASH, alcohol and hepatitis C cirrhosis, and in mouse models of liver inflammation and injury. This RNA-seq analysis identifies new genes that are regulated by the nuclear receptor SHP and implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of human chronic liver diseases. The results provide valuable transcriptome information for characterizing mechanisms of these diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Epidemiological studies have suggested a role of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the development of cardiovascular disease. We evaluated liver mRNA expression of 84 genes encoding proteins involved in the atherosclerosis pathway in patients with NAFLD proven through biopsy in a case-control design, and examined the putative role of the histological disease severity in the molecular events associated with the atherogenic profile.Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), when compared with simple steatosis (SS), significantly increases the expression of TGFB1 (6.8, p<0.005), angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) (2.1, p<0.007), LAMA1 (2.1, p<0.007), SERPINB2 (2.1, p<0.007), CSF2 (2.5, p<0.002), IL1A (2.5, p<0.005), IL3 (2.1, p<0.007), IL4 (2.1, p<0.007), LIF (2.1, p<0.007), and MMP1 (2.1, p<0.007), and decreases the transcript levels of genes involved in the negative regulation of cell-death pathways. A post hoc analysis of liver biopsies of NASH patients who were treated with enalapril monotherapy because of arterial hypertension showed a significant association with lower fibrosis scores in comparison with untreated patients. BIRC3, a severe hypoxia-activated gene, was significantly increased in SS (8.2, p<0.004), when compared with the controls. NASH, but not SS, was also associated with a significant increase in platelet abundance of TGFB1 mRNA. Systems biology analysis revealed highly scored pathways involved in the regulation of programmed cell death, angiogenesis, and immune system, in which TGFB1 was mostly involved.NASH, but not SS, may increase atherosclerotic and cardiovascular risk by local overexpression of mediators of atherogenesis, endothelial damage, and regulators of blood pressure; this observation may have therapeutic implications, because ACE inhibitors may improve both cardiovascular outcomes and liver fibrosis. Hepatocyte hypoxia seems to have an important role in the molecular events activated by liver steatosis.},

The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is involved in the pathogenesis of many acute and chronic liver diseases. TNF has pleiotropic functions, but its role in liver fibrosis has not been clarified. Chronic repeated injection of CCl4 induces liver fibrosis in mice. We examined whether signaling through TNF receptors was critical for this process, using mice lacking either TNF receptor (TNFR) type 1 or TNFR type 2 to define the pathophysiologic role of TNFR signals in liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis caused by chronic CCl4 exposure was TNF-dependent; histological fibrosis was seen in wild-type (WT) and TNFR-2 knockout (KO) mice, but not in TNFR-1 KO mice. Furthermore, a marked reduction in procollagen and TGF-beta synthesis was observed in TNFR-1 KO mice, which also had little detectable NF-kappa B, STAT3, and AP1 binding, and reduced levels of liver interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA compared to WT and TNFR-2 KO mice. In conclusion, our results indicate the possibility that NF-kappa B, STAT3, and AP1 binding by signals transduced through TNFR-1 plays an important role in liver fibrosis formation.},

  Abstract                 = {In most vertebrates, the liver produces bile that is necessary to emulsify absorbed fats and enable the digestion of lipids in the small intestine as well as to excrete bilirubin and other metabolic products. In the liver, the experimental obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary system initiates a complex cascade of pathological events that leads to cholestasis and inflammation resulting in a strong fibrotic reaction originating from the periportal fields. Therefore, surgical ligation of the common bile duct has become the most commonly used model to induce obstructive cholestatic injury in rodents and to study the molecular and cellular events that underlie these pathophysiological mechanisms induced by inappropriate bile flow. In recent years, different surgical techniques have been described that either allow reconnection or reanastomosis after bile duct ligation (BDL), e.g., partial BDL, or other microsurgical methods for specific research questions. However, the most frequently used model is the complete obstruction of the common bile duct that induces a strong fibrotic response after 21 to 28 days. The mortality rate can be high due to infectious complications or technical inaccuracies. Here we provide a detailed surgical procedure for the BDL model in mice that induce a highly reproducible fibrotic response in accordance to the 3R rule for animal welfare postulated by Russel and Burch in 1959.},

The aim of this study was to elucidate gene expression profiling in the whole liver of bile duct ligated (BDL) rats using microarray analysis. In addition, the localization and time course of up-regulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was investigated.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The whole liver was removed from BDL and sham-operated rats at day 2 after the procedure, and microarray analysis was performed using an array on which 3757 rat cDNA clones spotted. The up-regulation of VEGF expression was investigated by RT-PCR using livers at day 1, 2, 4 and 7, and immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry at day 2.Marked proliferation of bile ducts was observed in livers of BDL rats. By microarray analysis, 38 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated transcripts were detected in whole liver of the BDL rat. The expression of VEGF-A was significantly elevated in the BDL rats at day 2; the VEGF-A/GAPDH ratio was 4.030 +/- 2.493 in BDL rats and 1.159 +/- 0.125 in sham-operated rats (P = 0.0330). The up-regulation of VEGF-A expression was maximal at day 2. Immunoblotting also demonstrated up-regulated expression of VEGF-A at the protein level. Immunostaining of VEGF revealed that the expression was evident in hepatocytes adjacent to the portal tracts, and scarcely observed in hepatocytes at the centrilobular area or cholangiocytes.Gene expression profiling in the whole liver of the BDL rats revealed 38 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated transcripts. In addition, the up-regulated expression of VEGF was mainly observed in hepatocytes surrounding to the portal tracts.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most useful experimental fibrogenesis models is the "bile duct-ligated rats". Our aim was to investigate the quantitative hepatic collagen content by two different methods during the different stages of hepatic fibrosis in bile duct-ligated rats on a weekly basis. We questioned whether the 1-wk or 4-wk bile duct-ligated model is suitable in animal fibrogenesis trials.Of the 53 male Wistar rats, 8 (Group 0) were used as a healthy control group. Bile duct ligation (BDL) had been performed in the rest. Bile duct-ligated rates were sacrificed 7 days later in group 1 (10 rats), 14 days later in group 2 (9 rats), 21 days later in group 3(9 rats) and 28 days later in group 4 (9 rats). Eight rats underwent sham-operation (Sham). Hepatic collagen measurements as well as serum levels of liver enzymes and function tests were all analysed.The peak level of collagen was observed biochemically and histomorphometricly at the end of third week (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05). Suprisingly, collagen levels had decreased with the course of time such as at the end of fourth week (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05).We have shown that fibrosis in bile duct-ligated rats is transient, i.e. reverses spontaneously after 3 weeks. This contrasts any situation in patients where hepatic fibrosis is progressive and irreversible as countless studies performed by many investigators in the same animal model.},

  Abstract                 = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been implicated in the progression of many chronic liver diseases leading to fibrosis; however, the role of TNF in fibrogenesis is controversial and the specific contribution of TNF receptors to hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation remains to be established. Using HSCs from wild-type, TNF-receptor-1 (TNFR1) knockout, TNF-receptor-2 (TNFR2) knockout, or TNFR1/R2 double-knockout (TNFR-DKO) mice, we show that loss of both TNF receptors reduced procollagen-α1(I) expression, slowed down HSC proliferation, and impaired platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced promitogenic signaling in HSCs. TNFR-DKO HSCs exhibited decreased AKT phosphorylation and in vitro proliferation in response to PDGF. These effects were reproduced in TNFR1 knockout, but not TNFR2 knockout, HSCs. In addition, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) expression was dependent on TNF binding to TNFR1 in primary mouse HSCs. These results were validated in the human HSC cell line, LX2, using neutralizing antibodies against TNFR1 and TNFR2. Moreover, in vivo liver damage and fibrogenesis after bile-duct ligation were reduced in TNFR-DKO and TNFR1 knockout mice, compared to wild-type or TNFR2 knockout mice.TNF regulates HSC biology through its binding to TNFR1, which is required for HSC proliferation and MMP-9 expression. These data indicate a regulatory role for TNF in extracellular matrix remodeling and liver fibrosis, suggesting that targeting TNFR1 may be of benefit to attenuate liver fibrogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Fibrosis is a common end-point of a number of different diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, liver cirrhosis, and those associated with chronic inflammation. Fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix that interferes with normal tissue architecture and function. Increased expression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in fibrotic tissues has been reported in numerous studies. SPARC is a 43 kDa collagen-binding protein secreted from several different cell types into the extracellular matrix and has been shown to be anti-proliferative and counter-adhesive in vitro. SPARC is a matricellular protein; meaning SPARC is secreted into the extracellular space but does not serve a structural function. Instead, SPARC modulates interactions between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix. In animal models of fibrotic disease and in human fibrotic tissues, elevated expression of SPARC has been reported in many tissues including heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, dermis, intestine, and eyes. In this review, we will summarize current studies that have examined the expression and functional importance of SPARC in various animal models of fibrosis and in human tissues. Although cellular mechanisms of SPARC in fibrosis remain to be fully elucidated, the studies summarized here provide impetus to further explore the efficacy of SPARC as a potential target for reducing fibrosis.},

Genetic transporter variants contribute to an entire spectrum of cholestatic liver diseases and can cause hereditary cholestatic syndromes or determine susceptibility and disease progression in acquired cholestatic disorders. Cholestasis is associated with complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional alterations of hepatobiliary transporters and enzymes participating in bile formation. Ligand-activated nuclear receptors for bile acids and other biliary compounds play a key role in the regulation of genes required for bile formation. Pharmacological interventions in cholestasis may aim at modulating such novel regulatory pathways. This review will summarize the principles of molecular alterations in cholestasis and will give an overview of potential clinical implications.},

  Abstract                 = {Extrahepatic cholestasis leads to complex injury and repair processes that result in bile infarct formation, neutrophil infiltration, cholangiocyte and hepatocyte proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis. To identify early molecular mechanisms of injury and repair after bile duct obstruction, microarray analysis was performed on liver tissue 24 hours after bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham surgery. The most upregulated gene identified encodes plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1, Serpine 1), a protease inhibitor that blocks urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity. Because PAI-1, uPA, and tPA influence growth factor and cytokine processing as well as extracellular matrix remodeling, we evaluated the role of PAI-1 in cholestatic liver injury by comparing the injury and repair processes in wild-type (WT) and PAI-1-deficient (PAI-1-/-) mice after BDL. PAI-1-/- mice had fewer and smaller bile infarcts, less neutrophil infiltration, and higher levels of cholangiocyte and hepatocyte proliferation than WT animals after BDL. Furthermore, PAI-1-/- mice had higher levels of tPA activation and mature hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) after BDL than WT mice, suggesting that PAI-1 effects on HGF activation critically influence cholestatic liver injury. This was further supported by elevated levels of c-Met and Akt phosphorylation in PAI-1-/- mice after BDL. In conclusion, PAI-1 deficiency reduces liver injury after BDL in mice. These data suggest that inhibiting PAI-1 might attenuate liver injury in cholestatic liver diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is widely thought to promote the development of fibrosis in collaboration with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β; however, most of the evidence for its involvement comes from correlative and culture-based studies. In this study, the importance of CTGF in tissue fibrosis was directly examined in three murine models of fibrotic disease: a novel model of multiorgan fibrosis induced by repeated intraperitoneal injections of CTGF and TGF-β2; the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) renal fibrosis model; and an intratracheal bleomycin instillation model of pulmonary fibrosis.Intraperitoneal coadministration of CTGF and TGF-β2 elicited a profound fibrotic response that was inhibited by the human anti-CTGF antibody FG-3019, as indicated by the ability of FG-3019 to ameliorate the histologic signs of fibrosis and reduce the otherwise increased hydroxyproline:proline (Hyp:Pro) ratios by 25\% in kidney (P < 0.05), 30\% in liver (P < 0.01) and 63\% in lung (P < 0.05). Moreover, administration of either cytokine alone failed to elicit a fibrotic response, thus demonstrating that CTGF is both necessary and sufficient to initiate fibrosis in the presence of TGF-β and vice versa. In keeping with this requirement for CTGF function in fibrosis, FG-3019 also reduced the renal Hyp:Pro response up to 20\% after UUO (P < 0.05). In bleomycin-injured animals, a similar trend towards a FG-3019 treatment effect was observed (38\% reduction in total lung Hyp, P = 0.056). Thus, FG-3019 antibody treatment consistently reduced excessive collagen deposition and the pathologic severity of fibrosis in all models.Cooperative interactions between CTGF and TGF-β signaling are required to elicit overt tissue fibrosis. This interdependence and the observed anti-fibrotic effects of FG-3019 indicate that anti-CTGF therapy may provide therapeutic benefit in different forms of fibroproliferative disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Fibrosis is the hallmark of chronic liver diseases, yet many aspects of its mechanism remain to be defined. Chemokines are ubiquitous chemotactic molecules that mediate many acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, and CXC chemokine genes colocalize with a locus previously shown to include fibrogenic genes. We investigated the roles of the chemokine CXCL9 and its receptor CXCR3 in liver fibrosis.The effects of CXCL variants on fibrogenesis were analyzed using samples from patients with hepatitis C virus infection and by induction of fibrosis in CXCR3(-/-) and wild-type mice. In mice, intrahepatic immune cell subsets were investigated and interferon gamma messenger RNA levels were measured at baseline and after injury. Human serum CXCL9 levels were measured and correlated with CXCL9 variant and fibrosis severity. The effects of stimulation with CXCL9 were investigated on human hepatic stellate cells (LX-2).Specific CXCL9 variants were associated with liver fibrosis in mice and humans; CXCL9 serum concentrations correlated with genotypes and levels of fibrosis in patients. In contrast to other chemokines, CXCL9 exerted antifibrotic effects in vitro, suppressing collagen production in LX-2 cells. CXCR3(-/-) mice had increased liver fibrosis; progression was associated with decreased numbers of intrahepatic interferon gamma-positive T cells and reduced interferon gamma messenger RNA, indicating that CXCL9-CXCR3 regulates Th1-associated immune pathways.This is the first description of a chemokine-based antifibrotic pathway in the liver; antifibrotic therapies might be developed to modulate CXC chemokine levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholestasis is a pathological common component of numerous liver diseases that results in hepatotoxicity, inflammation, and cirrhosis when untreated. While the predominant hypothesis in cholestatic liver injury remains hepatocyte apoptosis due to direct toxicity of hydrophobic bile acid exposure, recent work suggests that the injury occurs through inflammatory necrosis. In order to resolve this controversy, we used novel plasma biomarkers to assess the mechanisms of cell death during early cholestatic liver injury. C57Bl/6 mice underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) for 6-72 h, or sham operation. Another group of mice were given d-galactosamine and endotoxin as a positive control for apoptosis and inflammatory necrosis. Plasma levels of full length cytokeratin-18 (FL-K18), microRNA-122 (miR-122) and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) increased progressively after BDL with peak levels observed after 48 h. These results indicate extensive cell necrosis after BDL, which is supported by the time course of plasma alanine aminotransferase activities and histology. In contrast, plasma caspase-3 activity, cleaved caspase-3 protein and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 fragments (cK18) were not elevated at any time during BDL suggesting the absence of apoptosis. In contrast, all plasma biomarkers of necrosis and apoptosis were elevated 6 h after Gal/End treatment. In addition, acetylated HMGB1, a marker for macrophage and monocyte activation, was increased as early as 12 h but mainly at 48-72 h. However, progressive neutrophil accumulation in the area of necrosis started at 6h after BDL. In conclusion, these data indicate that early cholestatic liver injury in mice is an inflammatory event, and occurs through necrosis with little evidence for apoptosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholestasis results in a buildup of bile acids in serum and in hepatocytes. Early studies into the mechanisms of cholestatic liver injury strongly implicated bile acid-induced apoptosis as the major cause of hepatocellular injury. Recent work has focused both on the role of bile acids in cell signaling as well as the role of sterile inflammation in the pathophysiology. Advances in modern analytical methodology have allowed for more accurate measuring of bile acid concentrations in serum, liver, and bile to very low levels of detection. Interestingly, toxic bile acid levels are seemingly far lower than previously hypothesized. The initial hypothesis has been based largely upon the exposure of μmol/L concentrations of toxic bile acids and bile salts to primary hepatocytes in cell culture, the possibility that in vivo bile acid concentrations may be far lower than the observed in vitro toxicity has far reaching implications in the mechanism of injury. This review will focus on both how different bile acids and different bile acid concentrations can affect hepatocytes during cholestasis, and additionally provide insight into how these data support recent hypotheses that cholestatic liver injury may not occur through direct bile acid-induced apoptosis, but may involve largely inflammatory cell-mediated liver cell necrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is activated in different cytokine signaling pathways. Deletion of Tak1 from hepatocytes results in spontaneous development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver inflammation, and fibrosis. TGF-β activates TAK1 and Smad signaling, which regulate cell death, proliferation, and carcinogenesis. However, it is not clear whether TGF-β signaling in hepatocytes, via TGF-β receptor-2 (Tgfbr2), promotes HCC and liver fibrosis.We generated mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Tak1 (Tak1ΔHep), as well as Tak1/Tgfbr2DHep and Tak1/Smad4ΔHep mice. Tak1flox/flox, Tgfbr2ΔHep, and Smad4ΔHep mice were used as controls, respectively. We assessed development of liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC. Primary hepatocytes isolated from these mice were used to assess TGF-β-mediated signaling.Levels of TGF-β, TGF-βR2, and phospho-Smad2/3 were increased in HCCs from Tak1ΔHep mice, which developed liver fibrosis and inflammation by 1 month and HCC by 9 months. However, Tak1/Tgfbr2ΔHep mice did not have this phenotype, and their hepatocytes did not undergo spontaneous cell death or compensatory proliferation. Hepatocytes from Tak1ΔHep mice incubated with TGF-β did not activate p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or nuclear factor-κB; conversely, TGF-β-mediated cell death and phosphorylation of Smad2/3 were increased, compared with control hepatocytes. Blocking the Smad pathway inhibited TGF-β-mediated death of Tak1-/- hepatocytes. Accordingly, disruption of Smad4 reduced the spontaneous liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC that develops in Tak1ΔHep mice. Levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, β-catenin, connective tissue growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor were increased in HCC from Tak1ΔHep mice, but not in HCCs from Tak1/Tgfbr2ΔHep mice. Injection of N-nitrosodiethylamine induced HCC formation in wild-type mice, but less in Tgfbr2ΔHep mice.TGF-β promotes development of HCC in Tak1ΔHep mice by inducing hepatocyte apoptosis and compensatory proliferation during early phases of tumorigenesis, and inducing expression of anti-apoptotic, pro-oncogenic, and angiogenic factors during tumor progression.},

  Abstract                 = {Activated fibroblasts are key contributors to the fibrotic extracellular matrix accumulation during liver fibrosis. The origin of such fibroblasts is still debated, although several studies point to stellate cells as the principal source. The role of adult hepatocytes as contributors to the accumulation of fibroblasts in the fibrotic liver is yet undetermined. Here, we provide evidence that the pro-fibrotic growth factor, TGF-beta1, induces adult mouse hepatocytes to undergo phenotypic and functional changes typical of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We perform lineage-tracing experiments using AlbCre. R26RstoplacZ double transgenic mice to demonstrate that hepatocytes which undergo EMT contribute substantially to the population of FSP1-positive fibroblasts in CCL(4)-induced liver fibrosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP7), a member of the TGFbeta superfamily, which is known to antagonize TGFbeta signaling, significantly inhibits progression of liver fibrosis in these mice. BMP7 treatment abolishes EMT-derived fibroblasts, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of BMP7 was at least partially due to the inhibition of EMT. These results provide direct evidence for the functional involvement of adult hepatocytes in the accumulation of activated fibroblasts in the fibrotic liver. Furthermore, our findings suggest that EMT is a promising therapeutic target for the attenuation of liver fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholestatic liver diseases can be caused by genetic defects, drug toxicities, hepatobiliary malignancies or obstruction of the biliary tract. Cholestasis leads to accumulation of bile acids (BAs) in hepatocytes. Direct toxicity of BAs is currently the most accepted hypothesis for cholestatic liver injury. However, information on which bile acids are actually accumulating during cholestasis is limited.To assess the BA composition in liver and serum after bile duct ligation (BDL) in male C57Bl/6 mice between 6 h and 14 days and evaluate toxicity of the most abundant BAs.Bile acid concentrations increased in liver (27-fold) and serum (1400-fold) within 6 h after surgery and remained elevated up to 14 days. BAs in livers of BDL mice became more hydrophilic than sham controls, mainly because of increased 6β-hydroxylation and taurine conjugation. Among the eight unconjugated and 16 conjugated BAs identified in serum and liver, only taurocholic acid (TCA), β-muricholic acid (βMCA) and TβMCA were substantially elevated representing >95\% of these BAs over the entire time course. Although glycochenodeoxycholic acid and other conjugated BAs increased in BDL animals, the changes were several orders of magnitude lower compared with TCA, βMCA and TβMCA. A mixture of these BAs did not cause apoptosis or necrosis, but induced inflammatory gene expression in cultured murine hepatocytes.The concentrations of cytotoxic BAs are insufficient to cause hepatocellular injury. In contrast, TCA, βMCA and TβMCA are able to induce pro-inflammatory mediators in hepatocytes. Thus, BAs act as inflammagens and not as cytotoxic mediators after BDL in mice.},

  Abstract                 = {E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) is an important regulator of metabolic diseases; however, its role in liver function remains elusive. This study unraveled a regulatory cascade involving E2F1, early growth response-1 (Egr-1), nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2), and EIA-like inhibitor of differentiation 1 (EID1) in cholestatic liver fibrosis. Liver E2F1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression was strongly up-regulated in human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcohol cirrhosis; the latter was inversely correlated with diminished SHP expression. E2F1 was also highly induced by 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1, 4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding and bile-duct ligation (BDL) in mice. E2F1-/- mice exhibited reduced biliary fibrosis by DDC as determined by Masson Trichrome and Picro Sirius red staining, and decreased serum bile acid (BA), BA pool size, and fecal BA excretion. In addition, cholestatic liver fibrosis induced by BDL, as determined by immunohistochemistry analysis of a1 collagen expression, was increased in SHP-/- mice but attenuated in hepatocyte SHP-overexpressed transgenic (STG) mice. Egr-1 exhibited marked induction in livers of SHP-/- mice compared to the wild-type mice in both sham and BDL groups, and reduction in STG livers. Egr-1 promoter was activated by E2F1, and the activation was abrogated by expression of SHP and its co-repressor EID1 in hepatoma cells Huh7, Hepa1, and stellate cells LX2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed the association of E2F1, SHP, and EID1 proteins with the Egr-1 promoter, and their direct protein interactions were determined by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Interestingly, E2F1 activated Egr-1 expression in a biphasic fashion as described in both human and mouse hepatocytes.E2F1 is a fibrogenic gene and could serve as a potential new diagnostic marker for nonalcoholic and alcoholic liver fibrosis/cirrhosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and contributes to acute liver inflammation. Much less is known about IL-8 in chronic liver diseases (CLD), but elevated levels were reported from alcoholic and hepatitis C-related CLD. We investigated the regulation of IL-8, its receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 and possible IL-8 responding cells in CLD patients.Serum IL-8 levels were measured in CLD patients (n = 200) and healthy controls (n = 141). Intrahepatic IL-8, CXCR1 and CXCR2 gene expression was quantified from liver samples (n = 41), alongside immunohistochemical neutrophil (MPO) and macrophage (CD68) stainings. CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression was analyzed on purified monocytes from patients (n = 111) and controls (n = 31). In vitro analyses explored IL-8 secretion by different leukocyte subsets.IL-8 serum levels were significantly increased in CLD patients, especially in end-stage cirrhosis. Interestingly, patients with cholestatic diseases exhibited highest IL-8 serum concentrations. IL-8 correlated with liver function, inflammatory cytokines and non-invasive fibrosis markers. Intrahepatically, IL-8 and CXCR1 expression were strongly up-regulated. However, intrahepatic IL-8 could only be associated to neutrophil infiltration in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). In non-cholestatic cirrhosis, increased IL-8 and CXCR1 levels were associated with hepatic macrophage accumulation. In line, CXCR1, but not CXCR2 or CXCR3, expression was increased on circulating monocytes from cirrhotic patients. Moreover, monocyte-derived macrophages from CLD patients, especially the non-classical CD16⁺ subtype, displayed enhanced IL-8 secretion in vitro.IL-8 is strongly activated in CLD, thus likely contributing to hepatic inflammation. Our study suggests a novel role of IL-8 for recruitment and activation of hepatic macrophages via CXCR1 in human liver cirrhosis.},

  Abstract                 = {In the cirrhotic liver, gene expression of the multifunctional cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) is up-regulated, but its cellular origin is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the expression of OSM protein and its specific receptor subunits, OSMRbeta and LIFRbeta in normal and cirrhotic human liver using immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis.OSM protein was expressed in Kupffer cells, variably in normal liver but consistently in cirrhosis. OSMRbeta was expressed at low level in hepatocytes of all normal livers examined, but in no cirrhotic sample. In contrast, LIFRbeta receptor was expressed weakly in normal livers, but much more intensely in cirrhosis, in reactive ductules, bile duct epithelial cells and perisinusoidal areas. Double immunostaining showed co-localization of LIFRbeta with cytokeratin 7, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), in bile duct epithelial cells, but not with alpha-smooth muscle actin, a myofibroblast marker.In human liver, OSM protein is expressed in Kupffer cells, variably in normals but universally in cirrhosis. The differential expression pattern of OSM and its receptors could allow for differential OSM signaling by alternative utilization of receptors to promote hepatocyte proliferation in acute injury and, with its homologue LIF, for the bile ductular reaction in cirrhosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Bile acid synthesis, transport and metabolism are markedly altered in experimental cholestasis. Whether such coordinated regulation exists in human cholestatic diseases is unclear. We therefore investigated expression of genes for bile acid synthesis, detoxification and alternative basolateral export and regulatory nuclear factors in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).Hepatic CYP7A1, CYP27A1, CYP8B1 (bile acid synthesis), CYP3A4 (hydroxylation), SULT2A1 (sulphation), UGT2B4/2B7 (glucuronidation), MRP4 (basolateral export), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), short heterodimer partner (SHP), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) and HNF4alpha expression was determined in 11 patients with late-stage PBC and this was compared with non-cholestatic controls.CYP7A1 mRNA was repressed in PBC to 10-20\% of controls, while CYP27 and CYP8B1 mRNA remained unchanged. SULT2A1, UGT2B4/2B7 and CYP3A4 mRNA levels were unaltered or only mildly reduced in PBC. MRP4 protein levels were induced three-fold in PBC, whereas mRNA levels remained unchanged. Expression levels of FXR, RXR, SHP, PXR, CAR, HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha were moderately reduced in PBC without reaching statistical significance.Repression of bile acid synthesis and induction of basolateral bile acid export may represent adaptive mechanisms to limit bile acid burden in chronic cholestasis. As these changes do not sufficiently counteract cholestatic liver damage, future therapeutic strategies should aim at stimulation of bile acid detoxification pathways.},
